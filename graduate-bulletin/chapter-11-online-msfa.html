<h2 id="submitting-an-application">Submitting an Application</h2>
<p>Applicants for the Online MS Finance and Analytics program may apply to begin study in the fall and spring quarters. Online MS Finance and Analytics program information and additional details are <a href="https://onlinedegrees.scu.edu/academics/masters-finance-analytics" target="_blank">available here</a>.

<h2 id="academic-standing">Academic Standing</h2>
<p>To remain in good academic standing, a student in the Online MS Finance and Analytics program must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in all work taken in the Leavey School of Business. A grade of C- is considered a minimum passing grade in each course. A grade of F is considered a failing grade, and the units will not be counted toward graduation requirements.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0, he/she will be placed on academic probation. A student then has one quarter to raise the GPA to a cumulative 3.0 or they will be dismissed from the program. Students failing required classes may be dismissed immediately if it is mathematically impossible to return to good standing and remain on track to graduate with his/her class.</p>
<p>The administration will contact faculty midway through the term to acquire a status update on academic performance to ensure students are aware of academic resources and tutoring in an attempt to resolve matters before they affect GPA.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0 at the end of his/her final quarter and all course requirements have been satisfied, no degree will be awarded until the cumulative GPA is a 3.0 or better through completion of additional graduate course work in the Leavey School of Business.</p>
