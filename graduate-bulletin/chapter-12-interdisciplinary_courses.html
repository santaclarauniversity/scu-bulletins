<h2 id="idis-3695-global-business-perspectives">IDIS 3695. Global Business Perspectives</h2>
<p>Through company sites and cultural visits, students learn to appreciate how business operates outside the United States. Country visits are bracketed by class sessions and pre-work followed by project presentations. Content varies based on the expertise of the faculty and the country visited. Past locations include Germany, France, China, New Zealand, Brazil, and India. <em>Prerequisite: Varies by course.</em> (4 units)</p>
<h2 id="idis-27003700-effective-business-communications">IDIS 2700/3700. Effective Business Communications</h2>
<p>Intensive practice in forms of communication specifically for business settings, geared to the student&apos;s level of prior preparation. The focus will be primarily on oral communication and writing to support the oral communication. Emphasis on communicating complex issues and quantitative data to inform, advocate or persuade. <em>Prerequisite: None.</em> (2 units)</p>
<h2 id="idis-3701-critical-business-presentations">IDIS 3701. Critical Business Presentations</h2>
<p>This course is designed to equip the student with speaking and presenting facilities in both formal and informal business settings. The class centers around multiple presentations on a variety of topics. Focus will be on learning to shape messages and presentations to different audiences and purposes. This one-unit course will afford an introduction to effective presentation skills that should then be implemented into later coursework and workplace interactions. Business Communication theory, presentation practice and critique, interpersonal interaction in both traditional and social media forums, and conveying qualitative and quantitative information will serve as components of the course. <em>Prerequisite: IDIS 3700.</em> (1 unit)</p>
<h2 id="idis-3799-managing-transitions-i-and-idis-3800-managing-transitions-ii">IDIS 3799. Managing Transitions I and IDIS 3800 Managing Transitions II</h2>
<p>These courses prepare students for the career transitions that they will encounter once completing Santa Clara University&apos;s MBA program. These highly relevant courses concentrate on the skills students require to succeed early on in their careers. These lessons learned will be applicable to transitions throughout the students&apos; careers. The courses are based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as an individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others&apos; accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals&apos; identities. <em>Prerequisite: IDIS 3799 is required for enrollment in IDIS 3800.</em> (1 unit)</p>
<h2 id="idis-3704-women-in-leadership">IDIS 3704. Women in Leadership</h2>
