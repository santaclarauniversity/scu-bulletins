It is the student’s responsibility to do </span><span>their</span><span> own work and to cite sources of information, whether paraphrased or quoted. </span><span>The library has resources to help avoid violations of academic integrity, including this site with </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://libguides.scu.edu/plagiarism/tips">tips on avoiding plagiarism</a></span><span> and this site explaining </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://libguides.scu.edu/plagiarism/citations">how to cite properly</a></span><span>. </span><span>In addition, course syllabi commonly elaborate on the specifics of academic integrity appropriate for the individual class.</span></p><p><span>Final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course. If the student wants to withdraw from the course but the instructor’s signature is required, the instructor is within </span><span>their</span><span> rights to sign or decline to sign an approval of the withdrawal. </span></p><p><span>Students should check with their program to ensure they understand program requirements. </span></p><h2 id="h.xfrexiejoh4a"><span class=" gdbold">Academic Integrity Protocol</span></h2><p><span>The Leavey School of Business is committed to academic excellence and integrity. Students are expected to do their own work and to </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://libguides.scu.edu/plagiarism/citations">cite any sources they use</a></span><span>. A student who is guilty of a dishonest act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of “F” for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to and including dismissal from the University, as a result of the student </span><span>conduct</span><span> process as described in the Graduate Business Programs Bulletin. A student who violates copyright laws, including </span><span>unauthorized distribution of</span><span> course assignments and syllabi</span><span>,</span><span> or who knowingly alters official academic records from this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action.</span></p><h2 id="h.o0s9hi6rrshy"><span class=" gdbold">Allegations within the Context of a Course</span></h2><p><span>These procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University community with a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind, as described in the Student Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, or the use of prohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allegation of student academic dishonesty. The following describes procedures for resolution by due process.</span></p><p><span>If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolution begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs the student of the suspicion. If the instructor judges, on the basis of available evidence, that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severity of the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, “F” on the particular assignment, or “F” for the entire course). The instructor will report, in writing, to the department chair, to the Dean (who may delegate this to the appropriate administrative resource in the Leavey School of Business), and to the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the matter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University </span><span>conduct process</span><span>. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom.</span></p><h2 id="h.2zr1o3vwkm21"><span class=" gdbold">Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions</span></h2><p><span>If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor’s decision, the student will contact the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the </span><span>d</span><span>ean of the business school or </span><span>their</span><span> designate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department.</span></p><p><span>The department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if </span><span>they</span><span> believe that the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only role is to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty member from a closely related department, and two student </span><span>conduct </span><span>board members. Staff in the </span><span>The Office</span><span> of Student Life will arrange for the participation of the student panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair.</span></p><p><span>The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a particular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection </span><span>is limited to a claim</span><span> that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evaluation. The objection is filed with the department chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student.</span></p><p><span>After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel, when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of her or his recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student, to the Dean (</span><span>or their delegate</span><span>), and to the Office of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course.</span></p><p><span>Decisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are intended to be confidential.</span></p><p><span>If the student wishes to withdraw from the course, </span><span>tuition refunds and fees will be assessed in accordance with the dates listed on the Graduate Business Academic Calendar for the term in which the disputed course is taken.</span></p></body>
