As an institution of higher education rooted in the Jesuit tradition, the University is committed to creating and sustaining an environment that facilitates not only academic development, but also the personal and spiritual development of its members.</span></p><p><span>This commitment of the University encourages the greatest possible degree of freedom for individual choice and expression with the expectation that individual members of the community will:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_cbuqqqmc7czg-0 start"><li><span>Be honest</span></li><li><span>Demonstrate respect for oneself</span></li><li><span>Demonstrate respect for others and property</span></li><li><span>Demonstrate respect for the law and University standards, policies, and procedures, their administration, and the process for changing them</span></li></ul><p><span>In keeping with this commitment, this Statement of Responsibilities and Standards of Conduct and related policies and procedures have been formulated to guarantee each student’s freedom to learn and to protect the fundamental rights of others. The University administration has established standards, policies, and procedures that are necessary to achieve its objectives as a Catholic, Jesuit university. These standards, policies, and procedures are inclusive of the laws of the nation, the state of California, and the local community.</span></p><p><span>All members of the Santa Clara University community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with the goals of the institution and demonstrate respect for self, others, and their property. Students living off campus are members of this community and, as such, are representatives of the University to the community-at-large. In this regard, students living off campus maintain an equal measure of accountability to the values and expectations of all members of this community as identified in the Student Conduct Code</span></p><p><span>Whether living in or traversing through the neighborhood, or parking in the streets, students are expected to adhere to the same high standards of conduct and behavior that are consistent with the students’ developing role as responsible and accountable citizens and reflect well upon the Santa Clara University community.</span></p><h2 id="h.r8q5shlgdqcl"><span class=" gdbold">Student Conduct Code</span></h2><p><span>All members of the University community have a strong responsibility to protect and maintain an academic climate in which the fundamental freedom to learn can be enjoyed by all and where the rights and well-being of all members of the community are protected. To this end, certain basic regulations and policies have been developed to govern the conduct of all students as members of the University community.</span></p><p><span>The University reserves the right to review student conduct that occurs on and off campus when such behavior is inconsistent with these expectations and the Student Conduct Code. In addition, students are responsible for the actions of their guests and will be held accountable for any violations of University standards, policies, and procedures by a guest. Students should accompany their guests while on campus. If necessary, the University reserves the right to limit the guest privileges of a student.</span></p><p><span>The following acts may subject students to disciplinary action:</span></p><ol class="lst-kix_vo77lyi4ypp1-0 start" start="1"><li><span>Engaging in any form of academic dishonesty such as plagiarism (i.e., representing the work or ideas of others as one’s own without giving proper acknowledgment), cheating (e.g., copying the work of another person, falsifying laboratory data, sabotaging the work of others), and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context. (Law students, refer to the School of Law code.)</span></li><li><span>Illegal use, possession, or distribution of drugs. The use or possession of equipment, products, or materials that are used or intended for use in manufacturing, growing, using, or distributing any drug or controlled substance.
