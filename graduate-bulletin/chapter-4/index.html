As an institution of higher education rooted in the Jesuit tradition, the University is committed to creating and sustaining an environment that facilitates not only academic development but also the personal and spiritual development of its members. This commitment of the University encourages the greatest possible degree of freedom for individual choice and expression, with the expectation that individual members of the community will:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li><span>Be honest.</span></li><li><span>Demonstrate self-respect.</span></li><li><span>Demonstrate respect for others.</span></li><li><span>Demonstrate respect for the law and University policies, procedures, and standards; their administration; and the process for changing those laws, policies, procedures, and standards.</span></li></ul><p><span>In keeping with this commitment, this Statement of Responsibilities and Standards of Conduct and related policies and procedures have been formulated to guarantee each student’s freedom to learn and to protect the fundamental rights of others. There can be no rights and freedoms if all who claim them do not recognize and respect the same rights and freedoms for others. In addition to the laws of the nation, the state of California, and the local community, the University administration has established policies, procedures, and standards deemed necessary to achieve its objectives as a Catholic, Jesuit university.</span></p><p><span>All members of the Santa Clara community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with the goals of the institution and to demonstrate respect for self, others, and their property. Students living off campus are members of this community, and as such are representatives to the community at large. In this regard, students living off campus maintain an equal measure of accountability to the values and expectations of all members of this community as identified in the Student Conduct Code.</span></p><p><span>Whether living in or traversing through the neighborhood, or parking in the street, students are expected to adhere to the same high standards of conduct and behavior that are consistent with the students’ developing role as responsible and accountable citizens, and that reflect well upon the Santa Clara University community.</span></p><p><span>All members of the University community have a strong responsibility to protect and maintain an academic climate in which the fundamental freedom to learn can be enjoyed by all and where the rights and well-being of all members of the community are protected. The University reserves the right to review student conduct that occurs on and off campus when such behavior is inconsistent with this expectation and the Student Conduct Code. The following acts subject students to disciplinary action:</span></p><ol class="lst-kix_list_1-0 start" start="1"><li><span>Engaging in any form of academic dishonesty, such as plagiarism (representing the work or ideas of others as one’s own without giving proper acknowledgment), cheating (e.g., copying the work of another person, falsifying laboratory data, sabotaging the work of others), and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context. (Law students, refer </span><span>to the School</span><span> of Law code.)</span></li><li><span>Illegal use, possession, or distribution of drugs.

If a student prefers not to have any information about themself released to anyone, that student must fill out a non-disclosure form and submit it to the Office of the Registrar. Requests for non-disclosure may be filed with the Office of the Registrar during the registration period and throughout the academic year. Once filed, the request remains in effect until the fall term begins for the following academic year, regardless of when the request was filed, unless a written request to remove it is received.

Parents’ financial information, including statements submitted with scholarship applications, also is excluded, by law, from inspection. Third parties may not have access to educational records or other information pertaining to students without the written consent of the particular student.</span></p><p><span>Former or current borrowers of funds from any Title IV student loan program should note carefully that requests for nondisclosure of information will have no effect on preventing Santa Clara University from releasing information pertinent to employment, enrollment status, current address, and loan account status to a school lender, subsequent holder, guarantee agency, U.S. Department of Education, or an authorized agent.</span></p><p><span>Students have the right to inspect and review their educational records at the following offices:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_909a7fsa2hi8-0 start"><li><span>The Office of the Registrar maintains official academic records, including application forms, admission transcripts, letters of acceptance, and a student’s permanent academic record.</span></li><li><span>The Deans, in their respective offices, maintain working academic files</span></li><li><span>The Office of Student Life maintains records relating to a student’s nonacademic activities.</span></li><li><span>Records relating to a student’s financial status with the University are maintained in the various student financial services offices.</span></li></ul><p><span>Students have the right to request the amendment of their educational records to ensure that they are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of a student’s privacy or other rights.

Judicial records are educational records, and are thereby subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the University’s Student Records Policy.</span></p><p><span>The judicial record is confidential and is only shared internally with University officials in instances when the student grants permission to release the record, or there is what FERPA defines “an educational need to know” basis for the request. The judicial record is maintained throughout the student’s enrollment and thereafter as indicated below. A student’s judicial record will only be released from the hard copy file to a person or party external to the University if the student has granted permission, where the disclosure of the record is permissible under the provisions of FERPA, or where the University is required to do so by law. The digital copy of the judicial record will only be released to an external person or party where the University is required to do so by law.</span></p><a id="id.3znysh7"></a><h2><span class=" gdbold">Retention of Hard Copy of Judicial Records</span></h2><ol class="lst-kix_list_2-0 start" start="1"><li><span>The hard copy file of a student’s entire judicial history is kept for a minimum of one academic year beyond the academic year in which the date of the last violation of the Student Conduct Code occurred. When a student commits a violation of academic integrity, the hard copy file is retained for the remainder of a student’s academic career.</span></li><li><span>The files of any student who has received one or more of the following sanctions will be maintained for three academic years beyond the academic year in which the student’s tenure in his/her current degree program at the University has ended:</span></li><li><span>Removal from University housing Disciplinary probation</span></li><li><span>Deferred suspension Suspension</span></li><li><span>The judicial files of a student who has been expelled will be maintained for seven years beyond the academic year in which the student’s tenure at the University has ended.</span></li></ol><p><span class=" gditalic">¹The recording of classroom lectures, discussions, simulations, and other course-related activity is governed by this University recording policy, which balances the legitimate needs of students with disabilities that require the accommodation, the intellectual property concerns of its instructors, and the privacy of its students. Federal law states that students with documented disabilities should be allowed to record classroom activity. The Office of Accessible Education (OAE) will determine if classroom recording is an appropriate academic adjustment, auxiliary aid, and/or service with respect to each individual student’s documentation.</span></p><p><span>The University reserves the right to change this policy at any time at its sole discretion.</span></p><a id="id.jttlddxbfs5k"></a><h2 id="h.xpcy6xtkkcnk"><span class=" gdbold">University Judicial Process</span></h2><p><span>When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the Assistant Dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied, or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student’s enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files.</span></p><p><span>If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the severity of the circumstances, including the student’s judicial history and previous academic integrity violations.</span></p><a id="id.qhwhroenwemj"></a><h2 id="h.9iqfcrnr3gbn"><span class=" gdbold">Allegations Outside a Course</span></h2><p><span>If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The Assistant Dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved.</span></p><p><span></span></p></body>
