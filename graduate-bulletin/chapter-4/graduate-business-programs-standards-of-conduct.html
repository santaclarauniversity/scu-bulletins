Any students who violate the terms and conditions of this agreement will face disciplinary action from their faculty and, if merited, the University.</span></p><h2 id="h.wen99cfo91uk"><span class=" gdbold">Professional Standards of Conduct Agreement</span></h2><p><span>Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business expects its Graduate Business Students to uphold high standards of professional conduct in addition to adhering to the university's Student Conduct Code.

For more information about service animals, please visit the </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.ada.gov/topics/service-animals/">Americans with Disabilities Act</a></span><span> information pages. An assistance animal, such as an emotional support animal, is not a service animal and is not permitted in the classroom.

In that case the handler must retain control of the animal at all times through voice, signal or other means.</span></p><p><span>Service animals must not display disruptive or aggressive behaviors which interfere with other people's use of classroom space and facilities.</span></p><p><span>If a service animal's behaviors or actions pose an unreasonable or direct threat to the health or safety of others, or do not conform to these guidelines Leavey School of Business administrators, staff, faculty, and students may request that the animal be removed from the classroom and Lucas Hall. If the service animal is excluded from the classroom and Lucas Hall, the individual with the disability is welcome to stay and will be reasonably accommodated by Leavey School of Business </span><span>personnel. </span><span> </span></p><p><span>Students are expected to adhere to Santa Clara University's </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.scu.edu/osl/student-conduct/">community standards &amp; student conduct code</a></span><span>.
