Students are assigned appointment times in the </span><span>Workday Student</span><span> system during the designated </span><span>I</span><span>nitial </span><span>R</span><span>egistration period. Appointment times are assigned based on the number of units a student has accumulated</span><span>, ranked from higher to lower GPA </span><span>(some exceptions apply). During the </span><span>I</span><span>nitial </span><span>R</span><span>egistration period, students may register for no more than 10 units. Upon completion of</span><span> </span><span>the </span><span>I</span><span>nitial Registration period, students may add, drop, or swap classes until the end of the first week of classes. Students may drop classes at any time during the quarter until the designated last day to drop classes. (See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter </span><span>3, and the Graduate Business Academic Calendar for relevant dates/deadlines</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>Prior to registering for classes, a student must resolve any registration holds that have been placed on </span><span>their</span><span> student record. To resolve a hold, the appropriate office(s) must be contacted. To navigate the </span><span>Workday Student</span><span> registration system effectively, students are encouraged to monitor their accounts and clear any holds in advance of </span><span>the registration period</span><span>. Students will not be able to add or swap any classes until their records are clear. New students are encouraged to clear any holds as soon as possible related to pre-program competencies and missing transcripts identified at time of admission.</span></p><p><span>Once classes have begun, students may withdraw from courses, without prior approval, up to the </span><span>date(s) listed in the academic calendar for that term</span><span>. Courses cannot be dropped once the final exam has been administered. (See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter </span><span>3 and the Graduate Business Academic Calendar for relevant dates/deadlines</span><span>)</span></p><a id="kix.zc2gs6dkjt7"></a><h2 id="h.e3or57930g8r"><span class=" gdbold">Prerequisites</span></h2><p><span>Before registering for electives, students are responsible for ensuring that they have completed all the prerequisites. Prerequisites for each course are listed in the course descriptions in this bulletin. Course prerequisites are reviewed annually by the academic departments.</span></p><p><span>Although not explicitly stated in the description of individual courses, when a course is named as a prerequisite, then its prerequisites also are included by reference, and all prerequisites must be satisfied before a student can enroll.</span></p><p><span>Workday Student, the SCU student record and registration system, does not allow enrollment in any class or onto any waitlist if the prerequisites for that course have not been completed successfully. The system recognizes current enrollment in prerequisite classes at the time of registration. Course instructors cannot waive prerequisites. </span></p><p><span class=" gditalic">Note: Graduation will not be approved until all prerequisites, required courses, and other requirements of the program have been fulfilled.</span></p><h3><span class=" gdbold">Wait Lists</span></h3><p><span>After the </span><span>I</span><span>nitial </span><span>R</span><span>egistration period, waitlists are used to enroll students </span><span>in available seats</span><span>. Students are allowed to add themselves to the waitlist through </span><span>Workday Student</span><span> for courses that have reached capacity during the </span><span>I</span><span>nitial </span><span>R</span><span>egistration period. Students who are on waitlists will be enrolled into available spaces, in the order in which they jo</span><span>ined the waitlist,</span><span> provided they do not have course time or section conflicts.</span><span> </span><span> The student is responsible for monitoring </span><span>their</span><span> position on the waitlist. Pending no conflicts exist, students will be registered automatically and are responsible for dropping the class if they are enrolled via waitlist and </span><span>no longer wish to take the course</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>At the end of </span><span>I</span><span>nitial </span><span>R</span><span>egistration, classrooms are assigned and capacities are increased accordingly. Once capacities have been increased, the waitlists are scheduled and processed until the day before classes begin. All waitlists are then purged and students can add themselves to a class, if space becomes available, up until the last day to add a class.</span></p><p><span class=" gditalic">Note: The only way to enroll in a course is through </span><span class=" gditalic">Workday Student</span><span class=" gditalic">. Instructors cannot add students to their class rosters.</span></p><h3><span class=" gdbold">Leave of Absence</span></h3><p><span>All students who do not register by the end of the first week of any quarter of the academic year will be </span><span>discontinued from their program, </span><span>unless they have been given a leave of absence. A leave of absence request must be </span><span>requested in Workday Student and approved by the Graduate Business Programs Office. </span><span>If a leave of absence is requested after registration has occurred, the student is responsible for dropping all classes in addition to filing for the leave of absence.</span></p><p><span>A leave of absence will be granted only for a specified period of time and normally not for more than one year</span><span> or a total of four individual quarters.</span><span> If the approved period for the leave of absence is exceeded and the student does not contact the Graduate Business Programs Office to request an extension by the end of the first week of the current quarter, the student </span><span>will be placed on the inactive list and, should they wish to return to the program, may be required to reapply to the program as a new applicant.</span></p><p><span>Leaves of absence are included in the six year program (MBA and MSIS) </span><span>and three year program (MSBA, MSFA MSM)</span><span> completion requirement,</span><span> and are required for the Fall, Winter and Spring quarters.  A leave of absence is not required for Summer term. </span></p><h3 id="h.ieveb3k8ikvl"><span class=" gdbold">Program Withdrawal</span></h3><p><span>To withdraw from the University, a written notification must be submitted to the Graduate Business Programs Office. The student is responsible for dropping an</span><span>y </span><span>courses they are enrolled in, through </span><span>Workday Student,if they request to</span><span> </span><span>withdraw</span><span> from the University.</span></p><p><span>Withdrawal from the University is not officially complete until the student clears obligations with the Bursar’s Office. Students on deferments or federal loans also must clear their financial obligations with the Bursar’s Office. Refund checks for approved graduate course withdrawals are issued by the Bursar’s Office. It is the student’s responsibility to contact that office and request disbursement. (See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter </span><span>3</span><span>.)</span></p><h3><span class=" gdbold">Readmittance</span></h3><p><span>A student who does not register for any quarte</span><span>r</span><span> and does not apply for a leave of absence, will be</span><span> discontinued from their program.</span><span> When a student is </span><span>discontinued</span><span>, an application for admission accompanied by a reapplication fee of $</span><span>158</span><span> </span><span>may be required to return to classes</span><span>. </span><span>If required, t</span><span>he student then will be considered for readmission on the same basis as a new applicant. The student also will be required to fulfill any additional requirements and satisfy any curriculum changes the business school may adopt during the interim period between registrations. Credit is not guaranteed for previous completed course work and no further leaves of absence will be allowed. </span><span>For credits to be considered, courses needed to be completed in the past 5 years of the student’s program start date.</span></p><p><span>If the student has attended another school, all transcripts must be sent to the Graduate Business Programs Admissions Committee, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053. All course work taken in the interim must be satisfactorily completed, and the student must be in good standing, in order to be considered for readmission.</span></p><h3><span class=" gdbold">Concurrent Enrollment</span></h3><p><span>A student in the MBA or M.S. Programs will not be allowed concurrent enrollment in Santa Clara University’s other academic programs or at any other university. Exceptions are  J.D./MBA, J.D./MSIS</span><span>, 4+1 Programs,</span><span> and courses taken elsewhere to satisfy pre-program competencies. Once a student has enrolled, no transfer credit for course work done at another university will be granted without permission from the Senior Director, Graduate Business Programs Academic Support and Records. Due to the nature and rigor of the MBA and M.S. Programs, a student’s full attention is required to maintain good standing in the program.</span></p><h3><span class=" gdbold">Principles for Faculty and Student Conflict of Interest</span></h3><p><span>The Leavey School of Business is committed to the development of good business practices in an open and collaborative environment. The faculty makes a reasonable effort to prevent conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts from developing with enrolled Graduate Business students.

Students are responsible for knowing all academic and administrative policies and regulations affecting their program of study and for abiding by all such policies and regulations during their period of enrollment at the University. Continued enrollment is subject to compliance with the academic and administrative policies and regulations as described herein and otherwise published by the University.

Requests must be associated with issues or events of an extreme nature that were unforeseen and beyond the control of the student. Poor performance in course work; missed deadlines; change of major or educational plans; or a course grade's adverse effect on the student's grade point average, probationary standing, or other eligibility are not sufficient reasons for granting an exception. </span></p><p><span>Students should submit their request and the appropriate documentation to the Graduate Business Programs Office at their respective delegated emails (</span><span class=" gduline"><a href="mailto:emba@scu.edu">emba@scu.edu</a></span><span>, </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="mailto:mba@scu.edu">mba@scu.edu</a></span><span>, </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="mailto:msprograms@scu.edu">msprograms@scu.edu</a></span><span>, </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="mailto:onlinegradbusiness@scu.edu">onlinegradbusiness@scu.edu</a></span><span>). The Graduate Business Programs Office and the Office of Registrar will review the request for exception within three to five business days from the date of submission and notify the student of the decision. </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Appealing the Decision of the Office of the Registrar </span></p><p><span>A student, who does not agree with the decision of the Registrar, can request an appeal by submitting a formal request for reconsideration to the Office of the Registrar. The request should describe the specific situation and explain the basis of the request for reconsideration. The student should also provide any relevant documentation. All requests for reconsideration must be submitted within ten business days of the original decision of the Office of the Registrar.</span></p><p><span>Once the request for an appeal is received, the Office of the Registrar convenes a three person panel consisting of an Associate Dean of the relevant College or School, the Dean of Academic Support Services (or designee), and an Associate Dean of Student Life (or designee). The panel will use the general standard that the basis of appeal must be related to issues or events of an extreme nature that were unforeseen and beyond the control of the student. The panel will review requests for exception within fifteen business days from the date of submission and notify the student of the decision within two business days.</span></p><a id="kix.wwrcduvinjej"></a><h2 id="h.75swabn7ecjm"><span class=" gdbold">Graduation Petition Process</span></h2><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Refer to the Student Responsibilities section in Chapter 5, Academic Information.</span></p></body>
