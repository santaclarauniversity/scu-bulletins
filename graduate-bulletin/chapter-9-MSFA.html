<p>Students in the MSFA program may receive credit for coursework taken previously in limited circumstances. A minimum grade of B is required in each class accepted for waiver credit. All waiver credit MUST be from a comparable Graduate Level Program.</p>
<p>The determination of whether prior coursework or professional qualification is sufficient for credit may be made by the Graduate Business Program Office staff. In unusual situations, students may be asked to prepare a petition outlining their prior preparation for faculty review.</p>
<p>This policy applies to matriculated students only. Course waivers may reduce the unit load in a given quarter.

Policies for a non- matriculated students may be different.</p>
<h2 id="leaves-of-absence">Leaves of Absence</h2>
<p>Due to the full-time nature of the MSFA program, a student requiring a leave of absence may be required to withdraw from the program. Alternatives to continuing their education should be discussed with the director, M.S. Programs.</p>
<h2 id="program-withdrawal">Program Withdrawal</h2>
<p>Students who want to withdraw from the program and the university must notify the Graduate Business Programs Office of their intent in writing. Some portion of the tuition may be refunded and will be determined at time of withdrawal notification. Withdrawal from the university is not complete until the student clears obligations with the Bursar&apos;s Office.</p>
<h2 id="transferring-into-another-graduate-business-program">Transferring into Another Graduate Business Program</h2>
<p>Transferring into another graduate business program is possible if the student is in good academic standing and has a minimum GPA of 3.0. A transfer will be granted only once, by application, and is at the discretion of the faculty director and the senior assistant dean.

<ul>
<li><p>M.S. transfer application</p>
</li>
<li><p>A brief personal statement (1 page) advocating transfer</p>
</li>
<li><p>A recommendation from a SCU faculty member attesting to performance and supporting the transfer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Faculty Director and Senior Assistant Dean will review the application, personal statement, and recommendation in concert with the student&apos;s GRE/GMAT score and academic performance in the current M.S. program before making a decision on the request.

<p>For information regarding entrance into the [MBA program after completion of the MSFA program]{.underline}, contact the Graduate Business Admissions Office, 116 Lucas Hall.</p>
<h2 id="academic-standing">Academic Standing</h2>
<p>To qualify for the MSFA degree, a student must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in all work taken in the Leavey School of Business. A grade of C- is considered a minimum passing grade in each course. A grade of F is considered a failing grade, and the units will not be counted toward graduation requirements.</p>
<p>Students who receive an F in a required course are eligible for <strong>immediate dismissal</strong> based on the availability of the course and its requirement as a prerequisite for other courses.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0, they will be placed on academic probation. A student then has one quarter to raise the GPA to a cumulative 3.0 or they will be dismissed from the program. Students failing required classes may be dismissed immediately if it is mathematically impossible to return to good standing and remain on track to graduate with his/her class.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0 at the end of their final quarter and all course requirements have been satisfied, no degree will be awarded until the cumulative GPA is a 3.0 or better through completion of additional graduate course work in the Leavey School of Business.</p>
<h2 id="student-responsibility">Student Responsibility</h2>
<p>Students enrolled in the MSFA program are required to follow the same policies and procedures as students in the evening MBA program. Each student is personally responsible for knowing all of the academic regulations of the graduate business school. This includes, but is not limited to: grading, honor code, leave of absence, withdrawal, and concurrent enrollment policies.
