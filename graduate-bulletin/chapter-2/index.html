All applicants who hold a bachelor’s degree from outside the United States are required to have their official transcripts evaluated by WES &lt;</span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.wes.org/">https://www.wes.org/</a></span><span>&gt; using their ICAP evaluation. We also accept evaluations from any NACES organization. We require course-by-course, cumulative GPA, and U.S. degree equivalency evaluation CAPS (electronic delivery). Exceptions are made for applicants with an undergraduate or graduate degree from an accredited U.S. university.</span></li><li><span>Admissions interviews are scheduled at the discretion of the Admissions Committee but are required for the Evening MBA, Online MBA, Online MS Programs, and Executive MBA Programs.</span></li><li><span>Official Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or Graduate Record Exam (GRE) score.

All contingencies are documented on the student’s Program Plan Card or acceptance letter and provided to the student at admission. All contingencies must be fulfilled by the timeline indicated on the student’s Program Plan Card or acceptance letter (some contingencies are required to be satisfied before enrollment or by the end of the student’s first term in residence, refer to your admission letter for required completion dates.)

Applicants are admitted based on academic ability indicated by college records and GMAT/GRE scores, demonstrated management potential (including work experience and recommendations), and motivation to complete a demanding academic program. Once accepted, a non-refundable tuition deposit is required prior to registration. The deposit is applied toward the student’s first-term tuition. Tuition deposits are not required for online programs.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Deferment</span></h2><p><span>Candidates admitted to the MBA and MS programs may petition for an admission deferment to the next subsequent term.  Acceptance of the deferment request is at the discretion of the Admissions Committee and requires submission of the non-refundable deposit.</span></p><p><span>If a deferment request is granted, candidates may be given a deferment of up to one year beyond that for which they were originally accepted (MBA only). Otherwise, they must formally re-apply. In addition, official transcripts of coursework taken in the interim must be submitted for review prior to the first quarter of enrollment.</span></p><p><span>The candidate must meet the curriculum requirements at first enrollment, not that of the admitted quarter.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Reapplication</span></h2><p><span>Students admitted to the program who cease registering for classes and do not apply for a leave of absence, who never register or take a leave of absence for longer than 4 consecutive quarters, must formally re-apply for admission. If the original application is on file, re-application requires only a completed application form, updated resume, and paid application fee. If the original application is no longer on file, essay responses, recommendation letters, official GMAT/GRE scores, and updated transcripts must be resubmitted.</span></p><p><span>Re-admission is not guaranteed. Applicants re-admitted must meet the curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission and must enroll for the respective quarter.
