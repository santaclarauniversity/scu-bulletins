We also accept evaluations from any NACES organization. We require course-by-course, cumulative GPA, and U.S. degree equivalency evaluation CAPS</span><span> (electronic delivery)</span><span>.

All contingencies are documented on the student’s Program Plan Card or acceptance letter and provided to the student at admission. All contingencies must be fulfilled by the timeline indicated on the student’s Program Plan Card or acceptance letter (some contingencies are required to be satisfied before enrollment or by the end of the student’s first term in residence, refer to your admission letter for required completion dates.)

Applicants are admitted based on academic ability indicated by college records and GMAT/GRE scores, demonstrated management potential (including work experience and recommendations), and motivation to complete a demanding academic program. Once accepted, a non-refundable tuition deposit is required prior to registration. The deposit is applied toward the student’s first-term tuition. Tuition deposits are not required for online programs.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Deferment</span></h2><p><span>Candidates admitted to the MBA and MS programs may petition for an admission deferment to the next subsequent term.  Acceptance of the deferment request is at the discretion of the Admissions Committee and requires submission of the non-refundable deposit.</span></p><p><span>If a deferment request is granted, candidates may be given a deferment of up to one year beyond that for which they were originally accepted (MBA only). Otherwise, they must formally re-apply.
