SCU is dedicated to increasing the ethnic and cultural diversity of the student and faculty community, and to activities and actions that will lead to a more just and humane society. Therefore, SCU strongly encourages applications from individuals with non-traditional backgrounds with high potential and aptitude.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Application Procedure</span></h2><p><span>Applicants for the Evening MBA, MSFA, MSIS, MSBA, MSMK and all Online MS Programs may apply to study in the fall or spring quarters.

All applicants who hold a bachelor’s degree from outside the United States are required to have their official transcripts evaluated by WES &lt;</span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.wes.org/">https://www.wes.org/</a></span><span>&gt; using their ICAP evaluation. We also accept evaluations from any NACES organization. We require course-by-course, cumulative GPA, and U.S. degree equivalency evaluation CAPS (electronic delivery).
