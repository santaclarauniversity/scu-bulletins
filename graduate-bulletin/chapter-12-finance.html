<p>This two-unit course provides an introduction to FinTech. It covers the evolution of &quot;traditional&quot; finance methods -- namely, the disruptions and innovations that have transformed: (i) how we access capital; (ii) how we allocate or invest capital; (iii) how we settle or transfer capital; and (iv) how we monitor and maintain the integrity of financial institutions and transactions. The main objective is to provide a foundation in the basic concepts and mathematics of these innovations and their applications. <em>Prerequisite: Basic understanding of financial markets and mechanisms</em>.
