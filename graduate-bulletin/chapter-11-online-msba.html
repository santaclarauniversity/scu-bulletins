<p>The Online Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program offers a robust educational experience that teaches the advanced analytics methodologies needed to take student&apos;s business careers to the next level. Created by the world-renowned faculty of the Leavey School of Business---and expertly curated by an advisory board of industry leaders---our dynamic Online MSBA curriculum delivers the essential principles, practices, and analytical tools to solve modern business challenges and accelerate student&apos;s careers. The online version of the program would maintain identical program learning objectives and content as the on-campus program. The curriculum emphasizes the fundamentals of data-driven decision making and the advanced tools to make sense of a vast amount of data. The program prepares students to be professionals in the fast-paced world of big data and artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="admissions">Admissions</h2>
<p>Applicants for admission to the Online MS Business Analytics program must have a U.S. bachelor&apos;s degree from an accredited college or university or its foreign equivalent before registering in the Leavey School of Business.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-an-application">Submitting an Application</h2>
<p>Applicants for the Online MS Business Analytics program may apply to begin study in the fall and winter quarters. Online MS Business program information and additional details are <a href="https://www.scu.edu/business/graduate-degrees/admissions/ms-programs/online-ms-business-analytics/" target="_blank">available here</a>. Admission correspondence also may be sent via <strong>email to <a href="mailto:onlinemsba@scu.edu" target="_blank">onlinemsba@scu.edu</a></strong>. <em>Refer to Chapter 2: Admissions for admissions requirements.</em></p>
<h2 id="academic-standing">Academic Standing</h2>
<p>To qualify for the Online MS Business Analytics degree, a student must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in all work taken in the Leavey School of Business. A grade of C- is considered a minimum passing grade in each course. A grade of F is considered a failing grade, and the units will not be counted toward graduation requirements.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0, he/she will be placed on academic probation. A student then has one quarter to raise the GPA to a cumulative 3.0 or they will be dismissed from the program. Students failing required classes may be dismissed immediately if it is mathematically impossible to return to good standing and remain on track to graduate with his/her class.</p>
<p>The administration will contact faculty midway through the term to acquire a status update on academic performance to ensure students are aware of academic resources and tutoring in an attempt to resolve matters before they affect GPA.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0 at the end of his/her final quarter and all course requirements have been satisfied, no degree will be awarded until the cumulative GPA is a 3.0 or better through completion of additional graduate course work in the Leavey School of Business.</p>
