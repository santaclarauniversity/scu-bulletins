                                <h1 id="combineddual-degree-programs">Combined/Dual Degree Programs</h1>
<p>The Leavey School of Business, in partnership with the School of Law, offers two combined degree programs; the J.D./MBA Program and the J.D./MSIS Program.</p>
<p>The Combined Degree Programs are designed to permit students interested in obtaining both the J.D. degree and the MBA or MSIS degree to complete both degrees in less time than if earned independently. This can be accomplished because certain course work taken at the School of Law can be transferred for credit toward the MBA or MSIS degree, and, conversely, certain course work taken at the Leavey School of Business can be transferred toward the J.D. degree.</p>
<p>The J.D./MBA dual degree prepares students to approach problems from the perspectives of both a business person and a lawyer. Joint degree lawyers will better understand the business problems that give rise to legal problems, such as issues in marketing, personnel policies, or financing. They can do more than simply determine whether a proposed solution is &quot;legal&quot;; joint degree lawyers can design and formulate an effective and imaginative solution that meets legal requirements and permits clients to best achieve their business objectives.</p>
<p>The J.D./MSIS degree allows students to develop a deep technological understanding of the legal issues in the Information Technology industry and to learn how to use technology effectively in a law practice. The joint degree may be especially useful for potential:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In-house lawyers for technology companies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lawyers representing computer software and hardware companies in technology license agreements or in litigation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Information security lawyers</p>
</li>
<li><p>Litigators who plan to develop expertise in complex e-discovery</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="admission">Admission</h2>
<p>To participate in a Combined Degree Program, students must first be admitted to the School of Law. During the first year of the J.D. Program students apply to the MBA or MSIS Program, following the regular admissions procedures, including taking the GMAT or GRE standardized test. Enrollment in the J.D./MBA Program is limited to full-time students with 45 units or less in the law school, including current enrollment. Students must be in good standing in the Law School to be considered for admission into the MBA or MSIS programs. Law students interested in applying for the J.D./MBA program must also submit a signed copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W5kO1yr3d6u2YrspmY5pReI6SP9fdzScELkYw1n8238/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">J.D./MBA Memorandum of Understanding</a> to both schools.</p>
