<h3 id="course-waiver-policy">Course Waiver Policy</h3>
<p>Due to the full-time nature of the MSBA program, a student requiring a leave of absence will be required to withdraw from the program. Alternatives to continuing his/her education should be discussed with the MS Program Director.</p>
<h3 id="program-withdrawal">Program Withdrawal</h3>
<p>Students who want to withdraw from the program and the university must notify the Graduate Business Programs Office of their intent in writing. Some portion of the tuition may be refunded and will be determined at time of withdrawal notification. Withdrawal from the university is not complete until the student clears obligations with the Bursar&apos;s Office.</p>
<h3 id="transferring-into-another-graduate-business-program">Transferring into Another Graduate Business Program</h3>
<p>Transferring into another graduate business program is possible if the student is in good academic standing and has a minimum GPA of 3.0. A transfer will be granted only once, by application, and is at the discretion of the director of admissions and the senior assistant dean.</p>
<p>Applications can be submitted between September 15th and March 15th of each academic year. Students wishing to apply for a transfer to another graduate business program will need to complete the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>M.S. transfer application</p>
</li>
<li><p>A brief personal statement (1 page) advocating transfer</p>
</li>
<li><p>A recommendation from a SCU faculty member attesting to performance and supporting the transfer</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Faculty Director(s) and Senior Assistant Dean will review the application, personal statement, and recommendation in concert with the student&apos;s GRE/GMAT score and academic performance in the current M.S. program before making a decision on the request. A transfer back to the MSBA is not possible once the student is approved to transfer to another graduate business program.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For information regarding entrance into the MBA program after completion of the MSBA program, contact the Graduate Business Admissions Office, 116 Lucas Hall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="academic-standing">Academic Standing</h3>
<p>To qualify for the MSBA degree, a student must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in all work taken in the Leavey School of Business. A grade of C- is considered a minimum passing grade in each course. A grade of F is considered a failing grade, and the units will not be counted toward graduation requirements.</p>
<p>Students who receive an F in a required course are eligible for <strong>immediate dismissal</strong> based on the availability of the course and its requirement as a prerequisite for other courses.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0, they will be placed on academic probation. A student then has one quarter to raise the GPA to a cumulative 3.0 or they will be dismissed from the program. Students failing required classes may be dismissed immediately if it is mathematically impossible to return to good standing and remain on track to graduate with their class.</p>
<p>The administration will contact faculty midway through the term to acquire a status update on academic performance to ensure students are aware of academic resources and tutoring in an attempt to resolve matters before they affect GPA.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0 at the end of their final quarter and all course requirements have been satisfied, no degree will be awarded until the cumulative GPA is a 3.0 or better through completion of additional graduate course work in the Leavey School of Business.</p>
<h3 id="student-responsibility">Student Responsibility</h3>
<p>Students enrolled in the MSBA program are required to follow the same policies and procedures as students in the evening MBA program. Each student is personally responsible for knowing all of the academic regulations of the graduate business school. This includes, but is not limited to: grading, honor code, leave of absence, withdrawal, and concurrent enrollment policies. Please refer to the Academic Information section, Chapter 4, for additional information.</p>
