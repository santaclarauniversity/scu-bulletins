Online MBA
==========

The Leavey School of Business is proud to offer an Online MBA that blends strong ethics and values with the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley. Utilizing a dynamic curriculum, students will learn what it means to be a discerning, forward-thinking leader and, in turn, how to become one. Our ultimate goal is to provide motivated professionals the education and access necessary to become influential in business while making the world a better place.

Residency
---------

MGMT 3000 launches the program and includes a required 3-day, on-campus residency. Students generally complete core courses before enrolling in electives. The program concludes with MGMT 3052, also a 3-day, on-campus residency experience. Both residency experiences require coursework prior to and after the weekend.

Silicon Valley Dashboard
------------------------

Designed to help turn ordinary professionals into Silicon Valley Professionals (SVPs), the Online MBA program provides a curriculum based in innovation and principled leadership. Throughout their [SVP Journey](https://onlinedegrees.scu.edu/media/blog/preparing-silicon-valley-leaders-for-success), students will be able to track their progress with the [Silicon Valley Professional dashboard](https://onlinedegrees.scu.edu/experience/silicon-valley-professional-student-experience). This integrative portfolio lets participants coordinate their elective courses and co-curricular experiences with their professional goals and invites them to reflect on their professional development during the program. The dashboard also acts as a networking resource, allowing students to interact with instructors, classmates, and mentors, and it provides a way for them to solicit and receive feedback on their current progress.
