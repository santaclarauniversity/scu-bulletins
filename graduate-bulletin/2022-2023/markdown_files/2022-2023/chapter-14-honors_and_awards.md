Beta Gamma Sigma
================

Beta Gamma Sigma is The International Business Honor Society that was founded in 1913. It recognizes and honors top performing students from around the world in business schools accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ([AACSB](https://www.betagammasigma.org/mainsitedev/about/affiliations/about-affiliations-aacsb?utm_source=Landing%20Page&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=BGS%20Branding&utm_content=AACSB)) and also a member of the Association of College Honor Societies ([ACHS](https://www.betagammasigma.org/about/affiliations/about-affiliations-achs?utm_source=Landing%20Page&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=BGS%20Branding&utm_content=ACHS)). The Mission of the International Honor Society Beta Gamma Sigma is to encourage and honor academic achievement in the study of business, to cultivate and celebrate leadership and professional excellence, to advance the values of the Society, and to serve its lifelong members. Members will receive educational and professional benefits through various programs, connections, and opportunities alike.

The Santa Clara University chapter was begun in 1955. Election to membership is the highest scholastic honor a business student can achieve. It is limited to outstanding students with promising success in the field of business and who rank in the top 15 percent of MBA/M.S./Online graduates.

The Beta Gamma Sigma calculations include the cumulative GPA of all graduates from each of the four terms pulled once a year in early Spring to screen for Beta Gamma Sigma eligibility. Terms included are Summer 2022, Fall 2022, Winter 2023, and Spring 2023. The GPA's are sorted and the top 15% of graduates from that term are identified.

We will re-evaluate Spring graduates after final grades are posted (late-June). Anyone with a GPA at or above the top 15% will be invited to join Beta Gamma Sigma at that time.
