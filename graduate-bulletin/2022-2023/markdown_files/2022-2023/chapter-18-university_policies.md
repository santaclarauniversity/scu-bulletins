University Policies
===================

Speaker Policy
--------------

The purpose of this policy is to ensure the right of free expression and exchange of ideas, to minimize conflict between the exercise of that right and the rights of others in the effective use of University facilities, and to minimize possible interference with the University's responsibilities as an educational institution.

The time, place, and manner of exercising speech on campus are subject to regulations adopted by the University administration. Orderly conduct, noninterference with University functions or activities, and identification of sponsoring groups or individuals are required. Outdoor sound amplification(either via a megaphone or speaker system). Refer to Sound Amplification for complete instructions for obtaining a sound permit.

Members of the faculty, academic departments, staff, administrative offices, or student organizations registered by authorized student government bodies may invite non-University speakers to address meetings on campus. Student groups that have not been registered by authorized student government bodies may not invite non-University speakers to address meetings on campus. If there would likely be extensive public notice or controversy associated with the presence of any speaker on campus, prior notice should be given to the head of the Office of Marketing and Communications in the case of likely inquiries from external constituencies of the University or media; and to the Director of Campus Safety Services in the case of possible protest or disruption. Except for unusual circumstances, the notice should be at least one week before the meeting or event is to occur.

The presence of a guest speaker on the campus of Santa Clara University does not necessarily imply approval or endorsement by the University of the views expressed by the guest speaker or by anyone else present at the event.

The person or organization sponsoring a speaker around whom there would likely be extensive public notice or controversy is responsible for including the above statement in its advertisement, announcements, and news releases. If deemed appropriate, the University administration may also require the above statement be read at the beginning of the event.

Whenever the University administration considers it appropriate in furtherance of educational objectives, it may require either or both of the following:

-   That the meeting be chaired by a person approved by the University administration

-   Any invitation to a non-University speaker extended by a registered student organization, member of the faculty, staff, academic department, or administrative department may be rescinded only if the President, or his authorized designee, determines, after appropriate inquiry, that the proposed speech will constitute a clear and present danger to the orderly operation or peaceful conduct of campus activities by the speaker's advocacy of such actions as:

-   Willful damage or destruction, or seizure of the University's buildings or other property disruption or impairment of, or interference with, classes or other University activities

-   Physical harm, coercion, intimidation, or other invasion of the rights of the University's students, faculty, staff, or guests Violation of law

**Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972**

Title IX is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on the sex or gender of students and employees in educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX states that: "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance." Title IX promotes equity in academics and athletics programs and activities, and prohibits all forms of sex and gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment and sexual violence.

Title IX also prohibits discrimination against a student based on pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery from any of these conditions. Students may request adjustments and accommodations based on pregnancy needs or on a pregnancy-related complication for as long as the the student's doctor deems the accommodation to be medically necessary. Requests for pregnancy-related accommodations can be made at the Office of Accessible Education's website.

The University provides resources and reporting options to students, faculty, and staff to address concerns related to gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct prohibited by Title IX and University policy, and, through training and education, works to prevent its occurrence. The University seeks to provide a consistent, caring, and timely response when sexual and gender-based misconduct occurs within the University community. When the University becomes aware of allegations of sexual misconduct, it will take prompt and effective action.

**What Constitutes Consent**

The University adheres to California's definition of affirmative consent for sexual activity. Affirmative consent means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Since individuals may experience the same interaction in different ways, it is the responsibility of each party to determine that the other has consented before engaging in the activity.

For consent to be valid, there must be a clear expression in words or actions that the other individual consented to that specific sexual conduct. Reasonable reciprocation can be implied. For example, if someone kisses you, you can kiss them back (if you want to) without the need to explicitly obtain their consent to being kissed back.

Consent can also be withdrawn once given, as long as the withdrawal is reasonably and clearly communicated. If consent is withdrawn, that sexual activity should cease. Consent to some sexual contact (such as kissing or fondling) cannot be presumed to be consent for other sexual activity (such as intercourse). A current or previous intimate relationship is not sufficient to constitute consent.

Consent is based on the totality of the circumstances evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances, including the context in which the alleged incident occurred and any similar previous patterns that may be evidenced. The question of whether the responding party should have known of the reporting party's incapacity is an objective inquiry as to what a reasonable person, exercising sober judgment, would have known, in the same or similar circumstances.

Consent is not voluntary if forced or coerced. Force is the use of physical violence or physical imposition to gain sexual access. Force also includes threats, intimidation (implied threats), and coercion that is intended to overcome resistance or produce consent Coercion is unreasonable pressure for sexual activity.

Sexual activity that is forced is, by definition, non-consensual, but non-consensual sexual activity is not necessarily forced. Silence or the absence of resistance alone is not consent. Consent is not demonstrated by the absence of resistance. While resistance is not required or necessary, it is a clear demonstration of non-consent.

A person cannot consent if they are unable to understand what is happening, asleep, or unconscious for any reason. A person violates this policy if they engage in sexual activity with someone they know to be, or should know to be, physically or mentally incapacitated. This policy also covers a person whose incapacity results from a temporary or permanent physical or mental health condition, involuntary physical restraint, or the consumption of incapacitating drug or alcohol. Incapacitation occurs when someone cannot make rational, reasonable decisions because they lack the capacity to give knowing/informed consent (e.g. to understand the "who, what, when, where, why, or how" of their sexual interaction).

Incapacitation is determined through consideration of all relevant indicators of an individual's state and is not synonymous with (under the) influence, impairment, intoxication, inebriation, blackout, or being drunk. It is not an excuse that the responding party was intoxicated and, therefore, did not realize the incapacity of the reporting party.

**Reporting Options**

There are confidential and non-confidential reporting options available. Confidential Resources include on and off campus mental counselors, health service providers, local rape crisis counselors, domestic violence resources, and members of the clergy and chaplains. Confidential means that what a reporting party shares will not be communicated with anyone else unless except in extreme cases of immediate threat or abuse of a minor. Confidential on-campus resources include

CAPS, Cowell Center, 408-554-4501; Wellness Center, 862 Market Street, 408-554-4409; and members of the clergy or chaplains. Link to the Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX to request support or assistance and/or to file an anonymous report.
