Student Conduct Code
====================

Statement of Responsibilities and Standards of Conduct
------------------------------------------------------

For the most current information on the student conduct code and all policies and procedures regarding the student judicial system, please refer to the Office of Student Life website at [www.scu.edu/osl](https://www.scu.edu/osl/).

The goal of Santa Clara University is to provide students with a general education so that they will acquire knowledge, skill, and wisdom to deal with and contribute to contemporary society in constructive ways. As an institution of higher education rooted in the Jesuit tradition, the University is committed to creating and sustaining an environment that facilitates not only academic development but also the personal and spiritual development of its members. This commitment of the University encourages the greatest possible degree of freedom for individual choice and expression, with the expectation that individual members of the community will:

-   Be honest.

-   Demonstrate self-respect.

-   Demonstrate respect for others.

-   Demonstrate respect for the law and University policies, procedures, and standards; their administration; and the process for changing those laws, policies, procedures, and standards.

In keeping with this commitment, this Statement of Responsibilities and Standards of Conduct and related policies and procedures have been formulated to guarantee each student's freedom to learn and to protect the fundamental rights of others. There can be no rights and freedoms if all who claim them do not recognize and respect the same rights and freedoms for others. In addition to the laws of the nation, the state of California, and the local community, the University administration has established policies, procedures, and standards deemed necessary to achieve its objectives as a Catholic, Jesuit university.

All members of the Santa Clara community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with the goals of the institution and to demonstrate respect for self, others, and their property. Students living off campus are members of this community, and as such are representatives to the community at large. In this regard, students living off campus maintain an equal measure of accountability to the values and expectations of all members of this community as identified in the Student Conduct Code.

Whether living in or traversing through the neighborhood, or parking in the street, students are expected to adhere to the same high standards of conduct and behavior that are consistent with the students' developing role as responsible and accountable citizens, and that reflect well upon the Santa Clara University community.

All members of the University community have a strong responsibility to protect and maintain an academic climate in which the fundamental freedom to learn can be enjoyed by all and where the rights and well-being of all members of the community are protected. The University reserves the right to review student conduct that occurs on and off campus when such behavior is inconsistent with this expectation and the Student Conduct Code. The following acts subject students to disciplinary action:

1.  Engaging in any form of academic dishonesty, such as plagiarism (representing the work or ideas of others as one's own without giving proper acknowledgment), cheating (e.g., copying the work of another person, falsifying laboratory data, sabotaging the work of others), and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context. (Law students, refer to School of Law code.)

2.  Illegal use, possession, or distribution of drugs. The use or possession of equipment, products, or materials that are used or intended for use in manufacturing, growing, using, or distributing any drug or controlled substance.

Judicial Records Policy
-----------------------

The Office of Student Life maintains a hard copy file and a digital record of a student's judicial history. Judicial records are educational records, and are thereby subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the University's Student Records Policy.

The judicial record is confidential and is only shared internally with University officials in instances when the student grants permission to release the record, or there is what FERPA defines "an educational need to know" basis for the request. The judicial record is maintained throughout the student's enrollment and thereafter as indicated below. A student's judicial record will only be released from the hard copy file to a person or party external to the University if the student has granted permission, where the disclosure of the record is permissible under the provisions of FERPA, or where the University is required to do so by law. The digital copy of the judicial record will only be released to an external person or party where the University is required to do so by law.

Retention of Hard Copy of Judicial Records
------------------------------------------

1.  The hard copy file of a student's entire judicial history is kept for a minimum of one academic year beyond the academic year in which the date of the last violation of the Student Conduct Code occurred. When a student commits a violation of academic integrity, the hard copy file is retained for the remainder of a student's academic career.

2.  The files of any student who has received one or more of the following sanctions will be maintained for three academic years beyond the academic year in which the student's tenure in his/her current degree program at the University has ended:

3.  Removal from University housing Disciplinary probation

4.  Deferred suspension Suspension

5.  The judicial files of a student who has been expelled will be maintained for seven years beyond the academic year in which the student's tenure at the University has ended.

The University reserves the right to change this policy at any time at its sole discretion.
