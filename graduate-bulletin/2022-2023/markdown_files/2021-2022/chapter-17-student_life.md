#### Student Handbook

You and the University share the responsibility for your education. In keeping with this commitment, the University has developed a Student Conduct Code and related standards, policies, and procedures to guarantee each student's freedom to learn and to protect the fundamental rights of others. The concept of rights and freedoms carries with it corresponding responsibilities for which students are accountable. It is the responsibility of all students, undergraduate and graduate, those living on campus and off campus, to know and abide by the standards, policies, and procedures that govern their conduct as members of the University community. The student handbook can be found here: [https://www.scu.edu/osl/student-handbook/](https://www.scu.edu/osl/student-handbook/)

#### Statement of Responsibilities and Standards of Conduct

A goal of Santa Clara University is to provide students with a general education so that they will acquire knowledge, skills, and wisdom to deal with and contribute to contemporary society in constructive ways. As an institution of higher education rooted in the Jesuit tradition, the University is committed to creating and sustaining an environment that facilitates not only academic development, but also the personal and spiritual development of its members. This commitment of the University encourages the greatest possible degree of freedom for individual choice and expression with the expectation that individual members of the community will:

-   Be honest

-   Demonstrate respect for oneself

-   Demonstrate respect for others and property

-   Demonstrate respect for the law and University standards, policies, and procedures, their administration, and the process for changing them

In keeping with this commitment, this Statement of Responsibilities and Standards of Conduct and related policies and procedures have been formulated to guarantee each student's freedom to learn and to protect the fundamental rights of others. The University administration has established standards, policies, and procedures that are necessary to achieve its objectives as a Catholic, Jesuit university. These standards, policies, and procedures are inclusive of the laws of the nation, the state of California, and the local community. All members of the Santa Clara University community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with the goals of the institution and demonstrate respect for self, others, and their property. Students living off campus are members of this community and, as such, are representatives of the University to the community-at-large. In this regard, students living off campus maintain an equal measure of accountability to the values and expectations of all members of this community as identified in the Student Conduct Code. Whether living in or traversing through the neighborhood, or parking in the streets, students are expected to adhere to the same high standards of conduct and behavior that are consistent with the students' developing role as responsible and accountable citizens and reflect well upon the Santa Clara University community.
