Center for Accounting Research and Education (CARE) 
===================================================

The Center for Accounting Research and Education (CARE) was established in 2000 to (1) expand and develop relationships among business students, faculty, and Silicon Valley accounting professionals and (2) promote scholarly accounting research at Santa Clara University.

Together with the Silicon Valley Executive Center (SVEC), the Center administers the Certificate for Advanced Accounting Proficiency (CAAP) program for post-graduate accounting education.

Along with the student-led SCU Accounting Association, CARE organizes and manages accounting informational events, career planning experiences, accounting career fairs, and recruiting activities for SCU undergraduate business majors and CAAP students.

In association with the SCU Advisory Board, SCU Accounting Association, and CPA firm recruiters, the Center maintains and periodically updates guidelines that regulate the recruitment of SCU business majors and CAAP students for CPA firm recruiting programs, internships and full-time positions. The Center also advises SCU Accounting/A&IS majors about professional accounting opportunities and recruiting decisions.

The Center raises scholarship funds for deserving first-year, sophomore, and junior Accounting and A&IS majors. Student applications for these scholarships are reviewed by a scholarship committee comprised of SCU accounting faculty. Scholarship recipients are honored at an annual awards ceremony and dinner organized by the Center.

The Center also raises funds to attract and retain accounting faculty and promote scholarly accounting research. CARE's research programs have been instrumental in contributing to our understanding of accounting's role and influence in modern society and enhancing SCU's international academic reputation.
