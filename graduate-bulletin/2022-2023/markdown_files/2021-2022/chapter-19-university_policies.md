University Policies
===================

Speaker Policy
--------------

The purpose of this policy is to ensure the right of free expression and exchange of ideas, to minimize conflict between the exercise of that right and the rights of others in the effective use of University facilities, and to minimize possible interference with the University's responsibilities as an educational institution.

The time, place, and manner of exercising speech on campus are subject to regulations adopted by the University administration. Orderly conduct, noninterference with University functions or activities, and identification of sponsoring groups or individuals are required. Outdoor sound amplification will be permitted only with explicit approval of the Vice Provost for Student Life or designee. (Refer to amplification of Sound)

Members of the faculty, academic departments, staff, administrative offices, or student organizations registered by authorized student government bodies may invite non-University speakers to address meetings on campus. Student groups that have not been registered by authorized student government bodies may not invite non-University speakers to address meetings on campus. If there would likely be extensive public notice or controversy associated with the presence of any speaker on campus, prior notice should be given to the head of the Office of Marketing and Communications in the case of likely inquiries from external constituencies of the University or media; and to the Director of Campus Safety Services in the case of possible protest or disruption. Except for unusual circumstances, the notice should be at least one week before the meeting or event is to occur.

The presence of a guest speaker on the campus of Santa Clara University does not necessarily imply approval or endorsement by the University of the views expressed by the guest speaker or by anyone else present at the event.

The person or organization sponsoring a speaker around whom there would likely be extensive public notice or controversy is responsible for including the above statement in its advertisement, announcements, and news releases. If deemed appropriate, the University administration may also require the above statement be read at the beginning of the event.

Whenever the University administration considers it appropriate in furtherance of educational objectives, it may require either or both of the following:

-   That the meeting be chaired by a person approved by the University administration

-   Any invitation to a non-University speaker extended by a registered student organization, member of the faculty, staff, academic department, or administrative department may be rescinded only if the President, or his authorized designee, determines, after appropriate inquiry, that the proposed speech will constitute a clear and present danger to the orderly operation or peaceful conduct of campus activities by the speaker's advocacy of such actions as:

-   Willful damage or destruction, or seizure of University buildings or other property Disruption or impairment of, or interference with, classes or other University activities

-   Physical harm, coercion, intimidation, or other invasion of the rights of University students, faculty, staff, or guests Violation of law

-   Other disorder of a violent or seriously disruptive nature

**Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972**

Title IX is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on the sex or gender of students

and employees in educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:

"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the

benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal

financial assistance." Title IX promotes equity in academics and athletics programs and activities, and

prohibits all forms of sex and gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment and sexual

violence.

Title IX also prohibits discrimination against a student based on pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy,

termination of pregnancy, or recovery from any of these conditions. Students may request adjustments

and accommodations based on pregnancy needs or on a pregnancy-related complication for as long as the

student's doctor deems the accommodation to be medically necessary. Requests for pregnancy-related accommodations should be directed to Disabilities Resources at 408-554-4109 or to the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, Loyola Hall, Suite 140, 408-551-3043.

**Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy**

Santa Clara University is committed to providing an environment free of gender-based discrimination,

including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual violence and assault, relationship (dating and

domestic) violence, and stalking. The University provides resources and reporting options to students,

faculty, and staff to address concerns related to gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct

prohibited by Title IX and University policy, and, through training and education, works to prevent its

occurrence. The University seeks to provide a consistent, caring, and timely response when sexual and

gender-based misconduct occurs within the University community. When the University becomes aware

of allegations of sexual misconduct, it will take prompt and effective action. This action may include an

initial assessment of safety and well-being, implementing interim remedies at no cost to the complainant

for protection and support, discussing how the complainant wishes to proceed, initiating an investigation,

and identifying appropriate avenues for resolution. The University's response will be overseen by the

Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX. The University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual

Misconduct Policy applies to all students, faculty, and staff, and includes any individual regularly or temporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or serving in an official capacity at Santa Clara University (including

volunteers and contractors). The policy applies to both on-campus and off-campus conduct and to online

actions that have a potential or actual adverse impact on any member of the University community, or which substantially interferes with a person's ability to participate in University activities, or which could affect a

substantial University interest or its educational mission. For more information about reporting, response,

and adjudication, please see the University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy or

contact the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, [www.scu.edu/title-ix](http://www.scu.edu/title-ix).

**What Constitutes Consent**

The University adheres to California's definition of affirmative consent for sexual activity. Affirmative

consent means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Since

individuals may experience the same interaction in different ways, it is the responsibility of each party to

determine that the other has consented before engaging in the activity.

For consent to be valid, there must be a clear expression in words or actions that the other individual

consented to that specific sexual conduct. Reasonable reciprocation can be implied. For example, if

someone kisses you, you can kiss them back (if you want to) without the need to explicitly obtain their

consent to being kissed back.

Consent can also be withdrawn once given, as long as the withdrawal is reasonably and clearly

communicated. If consent is withdrawn, that sexual activity should cease. Consent to some sexual contact

(such as kissing or fondling) cannot be presumed to be consent for other sexual activity (such as

intercourse). A current or previous intimate relationship is not sufficient to constitute consent.

Consent is based on the totality of the circumstances evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable

person in the same or similar circumstances, including the context in which the alleged incident occurred

and any similar previous patterns that may be evidenced. The question of whether the responding party

should have known of the reporting party's incapacity is an objective inquiry as to what a reasonable

person, exercising sober judgment, would have known, in the same or similar circumstances.

Consent is not voluntary if forced or coerced. Force is the use of physical violence or physical imposition

to gain sexual access. Force also includes threats, intimidation (implied threats), and coercion that is

intended to overcome resistance or produce consent Coercion is unreasonable pressure for sexual activity.

Sexual activity that is forced is, by definition, non-consensual, but non-consensual sexual activity is not

necessarily forced. Silence or the absence of resistance alone is not consent. Consent is not demonstrated

by the absence of resistance. While resistance is not required or necessary, it is a clear demonstration of

non-consent.

A person cannot consent if they are unable to understand what is happening, asleep, or unconscious for

any reason. A person violates this policy if they engage in sexual activity with someone they know to be,

or should know to be, physically or mentally incapacitated. This policy also covers a person whose

incapacity results from a temporary or permanent physical or mental health condition, involuntary

physical restraint, or the consumption of incapacitating drug or alcohol. Incapacitation occurs when

someone cannot make rational, reasonable decisions because they lack the capacity to give

knowing/informed consent (e.g. to understand the "who, what, when, where, why, or how" of their sexual

interaction).

Incapacitation is determined through consideration of all relevant indicators of an individual's state and is

not synonymous with (under the) influence, impairment, intoxication, inebriation, blackout, or being

drunk. It is not an excuse that the responding party was intoxicated and, therefore, did not realize the

incapacity of the reporting party.

**Reporting Options**

There are confidential and non-confidential reporting options available. Confidential Resources include

on and off campus mental counselors, health service providers, local rape crisis counselors, domestic

violence resources, and members of the clergy and chaplains. Confidential on-campus resources include

CAPS, Cowell Center, 408-554-4501; Wellness Center, 862 Market Street, 408-554-4409; and members

of the clergy or chaplains. Confidential means that what a reporting party shares will not be

communicated with anyone else unless except in extreme cases of immediacy of threat or abuse of a

minor.

**Reporting to Law Enforcement**

For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime of sexual violence, including sexual assault,

domestic/intimate partner violence, and stalking students, contact the Santa Clara Police Department, dial

911, or contact Campus Safety Services at 408-554-4444.

Drug Free Policies
------------------

It is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University's activities. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace even if it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct.

The unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and campus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clara premises where the activities of the University are conducted.

Violations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.

The program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and students. New staff employees are given a copy in New Employee Orientation. New faculty employees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation. The program is reviewed at least biennially by the Office of Student Life, Affirmative Action Office, and the Department of Human Resources. Contact the Office of Student Life for a complete copy of the program.

Gender Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy Purpose Statement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Santa Clara University is committed to providing an environment free of gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual violence and assault, relationship (dating and domestic) violence, and stalking. The University provides resources and reporting options to students, faculty, and staff to address concerns related to gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct prohibited by Title IX and University policy, and, through training and education, works to prevent its occurrence. The University seeks to provide a consistent, caring, and timely response when sexual and gender-based misconduct occurs within the University community. When the University becomes aware of allegations of sexual misconduct, it will take prompt and effective action. This action may include an initial assessment of safety and well-being, implementing interim remedies at no cost to the complainant for protection and support, discussing how the complainant wishes to proceed, initiating an investigation, and identifying appropriate avenues for resolution. The University's response will be overseen by the EEO and Title IX Coordinator.

The University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy applies to all students, faculty, and staff, and includes any individual regularly or temporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or serving in an official capacity at Santa Clara University (including volunteers and contractors). The policy applies to both on-campus and off-campus conduct and to online actions that have a potential or actual adverse impact on any member of the University community, or which substantially interfere with a person's ability to participate in University activities, or which could affect a substantial University interest or its educational mission.

Policy Statement on what Constitutes Consent
--------------------------------------------

The University adheres to California's definition of affirmative consent for sexual activity. "Affirmative consent" means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Under this definition, "No" always means "No." "Yes" means "Yes" only if it is a clear, knowing, and voluntary consent to any sexual activity. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent. Fully informed consent means that a person understands the details of a sexual interaction (who, what, when, where, why, and how).

It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in that activity. Consent can be given by words or action, but non-verbal consent is not as clear as talking about what a person does or does not want sexually. Consent to some form of sexual activity cannot be automatically taken as consent to any other form of sexual activity. Silence--without actions demonstrating permission--cannot be assumed to show consent. Consent is also not voluntary if forced or coerced.

Coercing a person into sexual activity violates the University's policy in the same way as physically forcing someone into sexual activity. Because alcohol or drug use can impair the capacity to consent, sexual activity while under the influence of alcohol or drugs raises questions about consent. It shall not be a valid excuse that the accused (hereafter "respondent") believed that the reporting party (hereafter "complainant"), affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the accused knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity.

Reporting Options
-----------------

There are several ways to report an incident of gender-based discrimination, sexual misconduct, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking.

For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime, students should call the City of Santa Clara Police Department: dial 911 or call Campus Safety Services: dial 408-554-4444.For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime, students should call the City of Santa Clara Police Department: dial 911 or call Campus Safety Services: dial 408-554-4444.

Confidential resources include on- and off-campus mental counselors, health service providers, advisors available through the University's Violence Prevention Program, local rape crisis counselors, domestic violence resources, and members of the clergy and chaplains.

Students may report incidents and seek support from University officials, including the EEO and Title IX Coordinator, Office of Student Life, Residence Life (including Community Facilitators, Resident Directors, Assistant Resident Directors, Neighborhood Representatives, and Assistant Area Coordinators), Spirituality Facilitators, Housing, Athletics and Recreation, Center for Student Leadership, Drahmann Center, Disability Resources, Career Center, and Campus Ministry. Theses University resources are required to report incidents to the EEO and Title IX coordinator, who will oversee investigation and resolution process.
