Online Programs
===============

Online Programs at the Leavey School of Business include the Online MBA, Online MS in Marketing, Online MS in Finance and Analytics and Online MS in Business Analytics. The admission requirements, tuition, learning objectives, degree requirements, faculty, policies, and procedures are the same as their corresponding on-campus counterparts. The online option caters to a broader population of students and expands our ability to offer cutting-edge, digital modes of education. Courses are asynchronous enabling students to study at their own pace and schedule at onlinelearning.scu.edu. The only required on-campus component is a 3-day on-campus residency at the start (all programs) and end (Online MBA only) of the program.

Admissions
----------

The Online MBA new cohorts start in Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer. The Online MS programs welcome new cohorts in Fall and Spring only. College-level calculus and statistics are prerequisites for the Online MS Finance & Analytics and Online MS Business Analytics programs.

The SCU Online Programs Alumni Pathway provides an expedited application process for SCU alumni. We believe in the strength of our undergraduate population and therefore for alumni accelerating the start of their graduate business education. The Alumni pathway waives the application fee, letters of recommendation, GMAT/GRE scores (waiver available), and personal essays if alumni applicants achieved a 3.0 GPA or above from the Leavey School of Business or a 2.5 GPA or above from the School of Engineering or STEM program. Online MS Programs will allow for a 3.0 GPA or above from the Leavey School of Business, College of Arts and Sciences, School of Education and Counseling Psychology, School of Law, School of Theology, or 2.5 or above from the School of Engineering or STEM program.

Currently, online programs cannot admit students on a F1 visa.

Student Success Seminar
-----------------------

Before the program begins students enroll in the Student Success Seminar. This is an open course, non-graded, to orient students to the online learning platform. It is highly recommended that students complete the seminar before starting their courses. The seminar sets expectations for what is needed to be academically successful as an online student and helps students plan for their own success. This course is available at onlinelearning.scu.edu.

Residency Requirement
---------------------

Each online program at the Leavey School includes a three-day residency to kick-off the program. All residencies consist of four parts: orientation, networking & career, in-person coursework, and immersion in Silicon Valley and Santa Clara University. The manner in which each of these is manifest varies by the needs of the program. Since all online program residencies occur on the same weekend faculty and students have the chance to mingle across programs and disciplines. Ultimately, the residency puts names to faces for online students, and creates a community for students who will not necessarily be in close proximity throughout the program. Other online students (at LSB) have consistently pointed to the relationships begun during their residency as a critical factor to their feeling connected to their cohorts and understanding what it means to "be a bronco."
