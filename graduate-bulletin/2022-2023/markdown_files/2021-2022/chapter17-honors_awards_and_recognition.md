Honors, Awards and Recognition
==============================

The Leavey School of Business Graduate Programs (GBP) offers a variety of awards and recognition to students for outstanding academic achievement. In addition to academic recognition, the Dean recognizes students for outstanding contributions to the graduate program and to the university.

Beta Gamma Sigma
----------------

Beta Gamma Sigma is the international honor society serving business programs accredited by AACSB International. Election to membership is the highest scholastic honor a business student can achieve. It is limited to outstanding students who give promise of success in the field of business and who rank in the top 20 percent of MBA/M.S. graduates.

Belotti Awards
--------------

As a result of the generosity of Dr.Â Mario Belotti, three awards are given to graduate business students and are endowed by the Mario Belotti Scholarship Fund. Award recipients must be degree-seeking students enrolled in the graduate business school. Awards are offered when the respective courses are offered during fall, winter, and spring quarters.

The Off to a Great Start award recognizes the two top students in each section of ACTG 3100 and MGMT 3500, the first classes students typically take in the program. The faculty teaching each of the respective sections selects the recipients.

The Turning the Corner award recognizes MBA students who have completed 34 to 40 units and MSIS students who have completed 24 to 32 units (including waived courses) and have a GPA of 3.9 or above. The award is offered fall, winter, and spring quarters. Students may earn this award only once during their time in the program.

The Home Stretch award honors the top group in each section of MGMT 3519, which students take after the completion of all core courses. The MGMT 3519 professors select the recipients of this award.

Dean's List
-----------

The Dean's List honors all students who receive a term GPA of 3.8 or above for the eligible term, if they were enrolled in a minimum of four units. Students who are not in good academic standing are not eligible for the Dean's List. Students are notified on a quarterly basis and recognition is acknowledged annually. The Dean's List is not awarded during the summer term.
