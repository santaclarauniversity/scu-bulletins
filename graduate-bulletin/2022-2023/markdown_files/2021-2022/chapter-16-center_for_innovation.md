Ciocca Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship
=================================================

Ciocca Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship provides opportunities for students from all disciplines to learn and explore the value of an entrepreneurial mindset. The center is guided by an interdisciplinary Student Advisory Board that includes both graduate and undergraduate students. Through academics, experiential learning programs, competitions, and coaching, and mentoring, students can immerse themselves in every aspect of the entrepreneurial experience.

Our hands-on programs include speaker events, business pitch and venture capital competitions, as well as experiential clinics where students and alumni have the chance to interact and work together on real world problems. The Bronco Ventures Idea School, Prep School, and Accelerator provide students the opportunity to learn how to start their own ventures. All of our programs offer students the chance to connect with and learn from other like-minded students, distinguished alumni, and industry professionals.
