Management and Entrepreneurship Curriculum
------------------------------------------

### MGMT 2504/3504. Innovation in Silicon Valley and Beyond

This course covers the skills, practices and processes for understanding and managing technology and innovation in fast paced environments. Students will learn to apply human-centric design thinking to decision-making processes related to innovation. The course delivery is informed by extant foundational and emerging empirical work in innovation. Students will engage in a project-based learning process to identify key innovation opportunities/problems and propose solutions for organizations. This course will complement content in elective courses (product marketing, product development, and intellectual property, small business entrepreneurship) and core courses in strategy. *Prerequisite: MGMT 3000.* (4 units)

### MGMT 2505. Business, Integrity and Society

This course focuses on the interplay between business and society, and examines managerial decision-making. The course challenges students to think about the role that business plays in society, and examines how organizations can help improve people's lives across the globe. The course also analyzes the root causes of corporate disasters and failures and looks at the role of human psychology therein. Students will be stimulated to think critically about their own ethical reasoning and will learn intervention strategies that may help to mitigate ethical risk factors in their own organization. *Prerequisite: None.* (3 units)

### MGMT 3200. Ethics for Managers.

This course is an introduction to business ethics that focuses specifically on the kinds of ethical issues that managers typically encounter. Course topics include the psychological factors that influence moral decision-making, normative approaches for dealing with ethical issues in management, and application of these concepts to cases describing real life ethical dilemmas managers have faced in a variety of organizational and environmental settings. *Prerequisites: None.* (2 units)

### MGMT 3050. Strategic Analysis

This course focuses on the processes by which managers position their businesses to develop and sustain an advantage relative to rivals in the face of uncertainty, rapid change, and competition. Strategy involves understanding the utility of different choices and tradeoffs -- choosing what not to do is as important as choosing what to do. As a result, the course covers a variety of tools, frameworks, theories and concepts for analyzing a firm's strategic position and the environment in which it is operating to inform the strategic decision making process. By covering the factors that make some strategic positions strong and viable, students will develop the ability to evaluate the effects of changes in resources & capabilities, industry forces, macro environmental forces, and technology on industry structure and firm behavior and, in turn, on a firm's opportunities for creating, capturing and sustaining a superior strategic position relative to rivals. The course also requires that students integrate and extend the knowledge and skills they have developed throughout their MBA program course work (i.e.Â marketing, finance, economics, organizational behavior, ethics, information systems, accounting, etc.) into a "total" business perspective. Analyzing real world situations best facilitates this activity; therefore, case analysis plays a large role in the course. Students will develop skills in formulating viable and defensible strategies and in evaluating the strategic choices and options. *Prerequisites: Completion of all core courses.* (4 units)

### MGMT 2512/3512. Leadership of Dynamic Organizations

Investigates and examines priorities of exemplary leaders. Emphasizes developing conceptual understanding of the leadership process and on building leadership skills.

### MGMT 3514. International Management

Encourages an understanding of the complexities of the global landscape and teaches the skills to analyze cross-border competition. While some argue that globalization has eliminated differences between nations and made the world one large market so that, as one journalist asserts, the "world is flat," this course will show that the reality is far more complicated. To deal with this complexity, firms, first, require leaders who are sensitive to and can bridge differences in culture and systems of government and, second, must innovate in new ways that leverage differences in economics and culture. *Prerequisite: MGMT 2501 or MGMT 3502 or MGMT 3000.* (3 units)

### MGMT 3516. Organizational Politics

Explores the use of influence and political skills in leadership and organizational decision-making. Emphasizes innovation and the politics of change. *Prerequisite: MGMT 2501 or MGMT 3500 or MGMT 3000.* (2 units)

### MGMT 2752/3716. Crowdsourcing and Expert-sourcing: Strategies for Innovation

Firms are rapidly adopting internet-based collaboration technologies (CT) to involve a wide range of participants in joint product innovation or co- innovation. Broadly defined, these technologies include software tools and applications that leverage social activity within an online platform to facilitate interaction and collaboration among members of an online community and between members of a community and a firm. As such, they help firms engage the creativity and problem solving skills of firm-hosted online communities of users, employees, and other experts in the creation, development and refinement of products or services. As a result, their use may yield innovations that strongly fit user preferences while also accelerating the pace and lowering the cost of product innovation. Despite the rapid adoption, many firms struggle with how to create value from CT-based co-innovation. Building on literature on user innovation, open innovation, and demand side value creation, this course explores the conditions for creating value when engaging online communities in co-innovation. The content focuses on non-open source contexts and community engagements that yield private gains for a host firm. *Prerequisites: MGMT 503 or MGMT 2501 or MGMT 3500 and ECON 401 or ECON 2401 or ECON 3402, and MKTG 551 or MKTG 2552 or MKTG 3552.* (1 unit)

As such, this class will explore what entrepreneurship means from several angles including how a person can be entrepreneurial in his or her own life - right now. This is an energized course about discovering entrepreneurship in and out of the firm. *Prerequisites: MGMT 3000.* (4 units)
