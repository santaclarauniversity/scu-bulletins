Online Master of Science in Finance and Analytics
=================================================

The Online MSFA program helps students develop the in-depth knowledge needed to excel in a management or C-suite role in the financial sector, or in a finance leadership role in any organization. Students will learn the intricacies of corporate finance, investments, and analytical tools as they build a rock-solid foundation of finance acumen.

Submitting an Application
-------------------------

Applicants for the Online MS Finance and Analytics program may apply to begin study in the fall and spring quarters. Online MS Finance and Analytics program information and additional details are [available here](https://onlinedegrees.scu.edu/academics/masters-finance-analytics). Admission correspondence also may be sent via email to [onlinemsfa@scu.edu](mailto:onlinemsfa@scu.edu). Refer to the Chapter 2: Admissions for admissions requirements.

Academic Standing
-----------------

To remain in good academic standing, a student in the Online MS Finance and Analytics program must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in all work taken in the Leavey School of Business. A grade of C- is considered a minimum passing grade in each course. A grade of F is considered a failing grade, and the units will not be counted toward graduation requirements.

If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0, he/she will be placed on academic probation. A student then has one quarter to raise the GPA to a cumulative 3.0 or they will be dismissed from the program. Students failing required classes may be dismissed immediately if it is mathematically impossible to return to good standing and remain on track to graduate with his/her class.

The administration will contact faculty midway through the term to acquire a status update on academic performance to ensure students are aware of academic resources and tutoring in an attempt to resolve matters before they affect GPA.

If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0 at the end of his/her final quarter and all course requirements have been satisfied, no degree will be awarded until the cumulative GPA is a 3.0 or better through completion of additional graduate course work in the Leavey School of Business.

Practicums occur over two quarters and are worth 2 units of course credit each quarter or 4 total units. (4 units)

### *IDIS 3598-C. Capstone* 

Capstone projects use data and examine analysis questions provided by faculty over the course of one quarter. Students refine the problem to scope the project, apply analytical tools to generate insights, interpret the findings, and summarize the findings in a final report. In certain situations, students with full- or part-time jobs or with an internship can approach their employers to find a suitable project if desired. In those instances, the employer and faculty would provide supervision. (4 units)
