<p>The course focuses on the skills, practices and processes for evaluating and managing technology and innovation in fast paced environments. Students learn to apply human-centric design thinking to the innovation decision making processes. The course delivery is informed by foundational and emerging empirical work in innovation. The content complements that in other elective courses (product marketing, product development, and intellectual property, small business entrepreneurship) and core courses in strategy. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="mgmt-3200-ethics-for-managers">MGMT 3200. Ethics for Managers.</h3>
<p>This course is an introduction to business ethics that focuses specifically on the kinds of ethical issues that managers typically encounter.

(2 units)</p>
<h3 id="mgmt-3050-strategic-analysis">MGMT 3050. Strategic Analysis</h3>
<p>This course focuses on the processes by which managers position their businesses to develop and sustain an advantage relative to rivals in the face of uncertainty, rapid change, and competition. Strategy involves understanding the utility of different choices and tradeoffs -- choosing what not to do is as important as choosing what to do. As a result, the course covers a variety of tools, frameworks, theories and concepts for analyzing a firm&apos;s strategic position and the environment in which it is operating to inform the strategic decision making process. By covering the factors that make some strategic positions strong and viable, students will develop the ability to evaluate the effects of changes in resources &amp; capabilities, industry forces, macro environmental forces, and technology on industry structure and firm behavior and, in turn, on a firm&apos;s opportunities for creating, capturing and sustaining a superior strategic position relative to rivals. The course also requires that students integrate and extend the knowledge and skills they have developed throughout their MBA program course work (i.e. marketing, finance, economics, organizational behavior, ethics, information systems, accounting, etc.) into a &quot;total&quot; business perspective. Analyzing real world situations best facilitates this activity; therefore, case analysis plays a large role in the course. Students will develop skills in formulating viable and defensible strategies and in evaluating the strategic choices and options. <em>Prerequisites: Completion of all core courses.</em> (4 units)</p>
