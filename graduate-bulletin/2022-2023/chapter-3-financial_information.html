<p><strong>Annual Graduate Student Health Insurance</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Santa Clara University requires all degree seeking students enrolled at least half-time in their school or college to have health insurance (excluding certificate and online programs)</em>.</strong> This requirement helps to protect against unexpected high medical costs and provides access to quality health care.</p>
<p>Students may purchase the university sponsored Student Health Insurance Plan but are not required to if they can provide proof of other insurance coverage comparable to the Student Health Insurance Plan as outlined in the benefit and waiver requirements on our <a href="http://www.scu.edu/cowell/insurance" target="_blank">website</a>. The premium for the 2022-2023 Student Health Insurance Plan is TBD. Students with comparable health insurance must complete the Online Waiver Form with their own insurance information. For details and deadlines on completing the waiver or on-line insurance enrollment option go to <a href="http://www.scu.edu/cowell/insurance" target="_blank">www.scu.edu/cowell/</a> and click on Student Health Insurance.</p>

<p><strong>F-1 VISA STUDENTS</strong></p>
<p>All F-1 visa international students, regardless of number of units, must be enrolled in the SCU-sponsored health insurance plan unless the student meets the <strong>waiver exception</strong> below.

<p><strong>Annual 2022-2023 Waiver Deadlines</strong></p>
<p>All students will be subject to the waiver and insurance billing process as outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>By July 22, 2022</strong> -- Health Insurance Waiver must be completed to avoid having your student account charged the annual premium on <strong>July 27, 2022.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>After July 27, 2022</strong> -- Online Health Insurance Waiver form must be completed by the <strong>waiver deadline of September 23, 2022</strong> in order to have the health insurance charge reversed from your student account within 3-5 business days.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>By August 21, 2022</strong> -- If the health insurance credit is not posted to your student account and financial arrangements to cover health insurance charge are not completed, then a <strong>late payment fee will be charged and a hold will be placed on your student account</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>By September 23, 2022</strong> -- The Online Health Insurance Waiver must be completed in order to have the health insurance charge reversed within 3-5 business days.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>After September 23, 2022</strong> -- The health insurance charge will remain on your student account. <strong>THIS CHARGE WILL NOT BE REVERSED</strong>.</p>

<p>All students are welcome to use the Cowell Center regardless of their insurance. Graduate students who have medical insurance other than the university sponsored Student Health Insurance Plan, may access health care services by paying a quarterly fee. Any fees associated with a student&apos;s visit will be billed to their student account for payment. We DO NOT bill insurance companies. Students may request a receipt from the receptionist at the Cowell Center so they may file a claim form with their insurance company.</p>

<h3 id="student-accounts-and-billing">Student Accounts and Billing</h3>
<p>Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrolling at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures. Students may designate a third party (e.g. spouse, parent, family member) to be an Authorized Payer for the purpose of reviewing the student account and billing information and remitting payment on their behalf. However, it is still the student&apos;s responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the published deadlines. Students receive monthly bills electronically and are accessible through University eCampus. A billing notification will be sent to the student&apos;s assigned SCU gmail account and to the e-mail address of any Authorized Payer. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remitting payment. In compliance with FERPA, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, Santa Clara University is prohibited from providing your student financial and non-directory academic information to a third party including parents, spouse, guardian, etc., without a release. This information includes, but is not limited to, all student billing items, awarded financial aid, enrollment status, 1098-T forms, and various student financial or academic information. Students can complete the FERPA information through eCampus. Log into eCampus, click the Academic tile, click FERPA release, and complete the required information.</p>
<p>Students are obligated to pay their applicable tuition and fees by the published term payment deadline. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to pre-pay for tuition before enrollment is granted. <strong>Registered students who do not formally withdraw from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their account, as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees.</strong></p>

<p>Currently enrolled students may be eligible to enroll in a monthly payment plan to assist with budgeting needs. The online <em>only</em> monthly payment plan can be accessed by logging into eCampus and selecting the Financial Account Tile. There is a $40 non-refundable enrollment fee each quarter and students must have a US bank account to enroll in the term plan. The first payment along with the enrollment fee are due upon enrollment and all subsequent payments will be processed automatically each month thereafter. Plans are subject to rebalancing based upon changes in enrollment and/or financial aid. Participants must enroll each quarter; there is no automatic re-enrollment. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar&apos;s Office website: <a href="https://www.scu.edu/bursar/paymentoptions/" target="_blank">https://www.scu.edu/bursar/paymentoptions/</a></p>
<h3 id="delinquent-payments">Delinquent Payments</h3>
<p>If all charges on a student&apos;s account are not cleared by payment, enrollment in the payment plan, financial aid, or loan disbursement by the payment deadline, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student&apos;s account and a hold will be placed on the student&apos;s record. A hold on a student&apos;s record prevents the release of diplomas and certifications, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default, in accordance with California state law.</p>
<p>Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recovering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be <strong>paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University.</strong></p>
<h3 id="refunds-for-credit-balances">Refunds for Credit Balances</h3>
<p>Refunds will be granted only for student accounts reflecting a credit balance. A refund will not be granted based on anticipated aid. All financial aid must be disbursed on to a student&apos;s account before a refund is processed. It is the student&apos;s responsibility to make sure all necessary documentation is complete and submitted to the Financial Aid Office so that aid can be disbursed properly and in a timely fashion. Payment received by personal check will have a 14 calendar day hold before a refund can be issued; electronic check payments require a 7 calendar day hold. Additional information related to refund policies can be found on the Bursar&apos;s website: <a href="http://www.scu.edu/bursar/refund" target="_blank">www.scu.edu/bursar/refund</a></p>

<p>If a student wishes to dispute any charges on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar&apos;s Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar&apos;s Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the item in question appeared.

<h2 id="return-of-federal-title-iv-funds">Return of Federal Title IV Funds</h2>
<p>All students who withdraw completely from the University and who have federal financial aid, including federal student loans, are subject to the return of Title IV funds policy. Under this policy, it is assumed that a student earns his or her aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled. Unearned Title IV funds, other than federal work-study, must be returned to the federal aid programs. Unearned aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV aid that exceeds the amount of earned Title IV aid.</p>
<p>During the first 60 percent of the enrollment period, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the period that the student remained enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student earned. Institutional costs play no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled</p>
<p>A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period.</p>
<p>All funds must be returned to federal programs before being returned to state or institutional aid programs and/or the student. This return of funds allocation will be made in the following specific order and will be applied to all students who have received federal Title IV assistance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct Graduate PLUS Loans) Subsidized Federal Direct Loans</p>
</li>
<li><p>Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other Federal, State, private or institutional assistance programs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="verification-of-information">Verification of Information</h2>
<p>The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students submit as a basis for aid awards. Each year, a percentage of students receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the information on which awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds.</p>
