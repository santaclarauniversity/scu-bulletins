<h2 id="admissions-decisions">Admissions Decisions</h2>
<p>Admissions decisions are made throughout the year on a rolling basis. Applicants are admitted on the basis of academic ability indicated by college records and GMAT/GRE scores, demonstrated management potential (including work experience and recommendations), and motivation to complete a demanding academic program. Once accepted, a non refundable tuition deposit is required prior to registration. The deposit is applied toward the student&apos;s first-term tuition.</p>
<h2 id="deferment">Deferment</h2>
<p>Candidates admitted to the MBA and MS programs may petition for an admission deferment to the next subsequent term. Acceptance of the deferment request is at the discretion of the Admissions Committee and requires submission of the non-refundable deposit.</p>
<p>If a deferment request is granted, candidates may be given a deferment of up to one year beyond that for which they were originally accepted (MBA only). Otherwise, they must formally re-apply. Official transcripts of course work taken in the interim must be submitted for review prior to the first quarter of enrollment.</p>
<p>The candidate must meet the requirements of the curriculum in effect at the time of first enrollment, not that of the admitted quarter.</p>
<h2 id="reapplication">Reapplication</h2>
<p>Students admitted to the program who cease registering for classes and do not apply for a leave of absence, who never register or take a leave of absence for longer than 4 consecutive quarters, must formally re-apply for admission. If the original application is on file, re-application requires only a completed application form, updated resume, and paid application fee. If the original application is no longer on file, essay responses, recommendation letters, official GMAT/GRE score, and updated transcripts must be resubmitted.</p>
<p>Re-admission is not guaranteed. Applicants re-admitted must meet the requirements of the curriculum in effect at time of readmission, and must enroll for the respective quarter. Credit is not guaranteed for previously completed course work. Deferrals are not permitted.</p>
<h2 id="request-for-courtesy-student-status">Request for Courtesy Student Status</h2>
<p>Students currently enrolled in an Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB)-accredited MBA program at another institution and who want to enroll at SCU may apply for courtesy student status. Courtesy Students may take a maximum of 6 units to be transferred to their MBA program in progress. The application must include a completed application form, resume, application fee, MBA transcript, and a letter from the current MBA program director clearly stating the specific courses the student will be permitted to complete at SCU. Registration is on a space-available basis and occurs after the registration period for matriculated students. Refer to Chapter 12 for course descriptions.</p>
