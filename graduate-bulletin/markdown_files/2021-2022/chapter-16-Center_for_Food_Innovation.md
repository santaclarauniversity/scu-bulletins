Center for Food Innovation and Entrepreneurship
===============================================

The Center for Food Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CFIE) has a long, distinguished history within the Leavey School of Business. Since its inception in 1973, the Center has graduated more than 1000 MBA students, many of whom now hold executive and management positions in the food industry throughout the world. CFIE faculty members are recognized scholars and instructors with expertise in a wide range of food industry issues.

The Concentration in Food Entrepreneurship is one of the few programs in the nation that combines a fully accredited MBA degree with an emphasis on management, innovation and entrepreneurship in the food industry. Students pursuing the Concentration in Food Entrepreneurship are eligible to receive financial aid from CFIE.

MBA students can join SCU's award-winning case study team as part of the International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA) annual conference. Students solve realistic business challenges and real-world issues and compete against teams from around the globe.

All students are encouraged to enhance their coursework with the enrichment programs offered by CFIE. Through the internship, fellowship, and mentor programs, students have the opportunity to apply their classroom education and learn from industry executives drawn heavily from CFIE's distinguished advisory board. Food industry visits provide students with the opportunity to learn about the many types of food businesses and explore a multitude of opportunities in the food industry.

CFIE has two new exciting virtual programs. Our videocast series *Join Us at the Table* features interviews with innovators, entrepreneurs, and experts in the food, food tech, and agriculture industry. Our webinar series *Meet the Industry - Connections, Jobs, and Resources in the Food Business* presents dynamic companies discussing job opportunities in the food and beverage industry and what they look for in an ideal candidate.
