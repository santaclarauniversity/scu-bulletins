Global Business Perspectives
============================

Global Business Perspectives are one- to two- week intensive courses examining the contemporary and dynamic global business environment. These courses provide intensive first-hand experience of global markets and products, leading to action and engagement, while students observe the challenges of overcoming cultural and local factors working against globalization. Students will analyze the global context of business and the human impact at hand, while practicing the skills to address such issues in Silicon Valley and abroad. The Global Business Perspectives courses are electives and may count toward concentrations, depending on topics covered.
