Academic Information
====================

Student Records
---------------

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the confidentiality of the University records of Santa Clara University students. The University is authorized under provisions of the Act to release directory information to any person on request, unless a student explicitly requests in writing that the University not do so and keep directory information confidential.

"Directory Information" includes the following items:

-   Name

-   Address (campus, local and/or permanent; e-mail) Telephone number

-   Date and place of birth Photographic image

-   Major field of study, classification, dates of attendance, expected graduation date, degrees, and honors received Most recent previous educational institution attended

-   Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics height and weight of participants on intercollegiate athletic teams

No other information may be released concerning a student without the written authorization of that student. If a student prefers not to have any information about herself/himself released to anyone, that student must fill out a non-disclosure form and submit it to the Office of the Registrar. Requests for non-disclosure may be filed with the Office of the Registrar during the registration period and throughout the academic year. Once filed, the request remains in effect until the fall term begins for the following academic year--regardless of when the request was filed--unless a written request to remove it is received. Requests for non-disclosure by students in their last term of enrollment remain in effect until cancelled by the student. Requests from former students are honored at the University's discretion.

Certain records are excluded by law from inspection, specifically those created or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist in connection with the treatment or counseling of a student. Parents' financial information, including statements submitted with scholarship applications, also is excluded by law from inspection. Third parties may not have access to educational records or other information pertaining to students without the written consent of the particular student.

Former or current borrowers of funds from any Title IV student loan program should note carefully that requests for nondisclosure of information will have no effect on preventing Santa Clara University from releasing information pertinent to employment, enrollment status, current address, and loan account status to a school lender, subsequent holder, guarantee agency, U.S. Department of Education, or an authorized agent.

Students have the right to inspect and review their educational records at the following offices:

-   The Office of the Registrar maintains official academic records, including application forms, admission transcripts, letters of acceptance, and a student's permanent academic record.

-   The Deans, in their respective offices, maintain working academic files

-   The Office of Student Life maintains records relating to a student's nonacademic activities.

-   Records relating to a student's financial status with the University are maintained in the various student financial services offices.

Students have the right to request the amendment of their educational records to ensure that they are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of a student's privacy or other rights. Students may direct complaints regarding academic records to the Dean of the college or school in which they are enrolled or to the University registrar. In addition, students have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Santa Clara University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Written complaints should be directed to the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Ave., S.W., Washington, D.C. 20202-5920.

Detailed information can be found on the [Family Compliance Office website](http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/index.html):

Campus Security and Crime Statistics Act
----------------------------------------

The U.S. Department of Education requires universities that receive Title IV funding to disclose certain information, including institutional graduation rates, athlete graduation rates, financial assistance awarded, and crime statistics. Information presented in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act is made available to assist current and potential students and employees in making informed decisions regarding their attendance or employment with Santa Clara University. To view the Santa Clara University reports, visit the [Campus Safety Services website](https://www.scu.edu/vice-provost-for-student-life/campus-safety/our-services/).

A paper copy of the annual crime statistics report may be obtained by writing to Campus Safety Services, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053.

Academic Regulations
--------------------

### Student Responsibility

***All official communication from the University and Graduate Business Programs is sent to the student's Santa Clara University email address.***

The student is personally responsible for knowing all of the academic regulations in the MBA or M.S. Program in which they are enrolled. Failure to understand these regulations and requirements does not relieve the student of responsibility. The student is responsible for resolving any holds placed on his or her record.

### Honor Code

As an institution of higher education rooted in the Jesuit tradition, Santa Clara University is committed to creating and sustaining an environment that facilitates students' academic, personal, and ethical development. This commitment balances freedom of individual choice and expression with the expectation that individual members of the community will:

-   Be honest

-   Demonstrate self-respect and respect for others

-   Demonstrate respect for the law and University policies, procedures, and standards.

Engaging in any form of academic dishonesty, such as plagiarism (representing the work or ideas of others as one's own without giving proper acknowledgment), cheating (e.g., using unauthorized resources or assistance on coursework, copying the work of another person, falsifying data, sabotaging the work of others, and the unauthorized use of electronics, media, or data), or other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context will subject the student to disciplinary action.

Every student is required to sign the honor code and adhere to its conditions.

### Academic Integrity

The University is committed to academic excellence and integrity. It is the student's responsibility to do his/her own work and to cite sources of information, whether paraphrased or quoted. For assistance in identifying when something should be [cited please check here](http://www.plagiarism.org/). In addition, course syllabi commonly elaborate on the specifics of academic integrity appropriate for the individual class.

Final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course. If the student wants to withdraw from the course but the instructor's signature is required, the instructor is within his/her rights to sign or decline to sign an approval of the withdrawal.

Students should check with their program to ensure they understand program requirements.

### Academic Integrity Protocol

The Leavey School of Business is committed to academic excellence and integrity. Students are expected to do their own work and to cite any sources they use. A student who is guilty of a dishonest act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of "F" for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to and including dismissal from the University, as a result of the student judicial process as described in the Graduate Business Programs Bulletin. A student who violates copyright laws, including those covering the copying of software programs, or who knowingly alters official academic records from this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action.

***Allegations within the Context of a Course***

These procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University community with a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind as described in the Student Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, or the use of prohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allegation of student academic dishonesty. The following describes procedures for resolution by due process.

If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolution begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs the student of the suspicion. If the instructor judges on the basis of available evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severity of the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, "F" on the particular assignment, or "F" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair, to the Dean (who may delegate this to the appropriate administrative resource in the Leavey School of Business), and to the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the matter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom.

***Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions***

If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor's decision, the student will contact the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or his/her designate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department.

The department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if he or she believes that the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only role is to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty member from a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the

Office of Student Life will arrange for the participation of the student panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair.

The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a particular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon a belief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evaluation and therefore will not review the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student.

After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of her or his recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student, to the Dean (who may delegate this to the appropriate administrative resource in the Leavey School of Business), and to the Office of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course.

Decisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are intended to be confidential.

If the student wishes to withdraw from the course, the instructor's approval is required for the withdrawal process. The instructor may refuse to approve of the withdrawal and assign an appropriate grade.

***University Judicial Process***

When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the Senior Assistant Dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files.

If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the severity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integrity violations.

***Allegations Outside a Course***

If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The Senior Assistant Dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved.

### Attendance

Students are expected to attend class sessions. Specific attendance requirements are set by the faculty in the syllabi of individual courses and are binding. Students should select courses carefully in a quarter when an unavoidable absence is necessary. Attendance during the first week of the quarter is critical. Students are not automatically dropped from a class if they do not attend.

### Completion Requirements

The requirements for the MBA or MSIS degree must be completed within six years of admission, including leaves of absence and any other break in attendance. Requests for an extension of the six-year completion requirement must be made in writing and include a detailed plan of how and when the requirements will be met. Approval of the extension request is at the discretion of the senior director, Graduate Business Programs Academic Support and Records. For, MSFA and MSBA program completion requirements, contact the M.S. Programs Director.

### Academic Standing

Students must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in all work taken in the Leavey School of Business. A grade of C- is considered a minimum passing grade in each course. A grade of F is considered a failing grade, and the units will not be counted toward graduation requirements.

If a student has a cumulative GPA below 3.0 during the first 17 units of study, he/she will be placed on academic warning. After completing 17 units, students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing. Students on academic probation have the following 2 quarters of attendance to meet the minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA requirement. If the student fails to increase the cumulative GPA to 3.0, he/she may be disqualified from the program.

A student is allowed to appeal a disqualification one time only. The process begins with the student submitting a written appeal, including the steps to be taken to reestablish good academic standing. Further registration will not be allowed until the written appeal has been approved. Upon approval, the student will be responsible for adhering to the plan outlined in the appeal. If, at any time, the conditions of the appeal are not met, or the student is not consistently making academic progress, the student will be withdrawn from all classes and required to leave the program.

Academic probation and disqualification status are noted on the student's transcript but academic warning status is not noted. Because of the short timeframe of the MSBA and MSF programs, the above policy has been revised for these students as follows:

**Please review the chapters for M.S. programs in this bulletin for academic standing policies.**

The administration will contact faculty midway through the term to acquire a status update on academic performance, and to ensure that students are aware of academic resources and tutoring in an attempt to assist the student in improving performance.

*If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0 at the end of his/her final quarter and all course requirements have been satisfied, no degree will be awarded until the cumulative GPA is a 3.0 or better through completion of additional coursework in the SCU graduate business school.*

### Grading

*The grading system is as follows:*

|     A           |     B           |     C           |     F          |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
|     A = 4.0     |     B+ = 3.3    |     C+ = 2.3    |     F = 0.0    |
|     A- = 3.7    |     B = 3.0     |     C = 2.0     |                |
|                 |     B- = 2.7    |     C- = 1.7    |                |

The A grade indicates distinguished performance and competence; the A- and B+ ranges indicate excellent performance and competence; and a B grade demonstrates work meeting academic and professional standards. Grades in the B- and C+ ranges are given for acceptable performance levels in a particular course but are insufficient for meeting overall performance requirements and graduation requirements. A C- grade is the minimal passing grade. A grade of F is given for performance that insufficiently demonstrates academic and professional competence. Instructors may assign grades without pluses and minuses at their discretion.

The University also uses the following designators for which no unit credit or grade point value is granted:

I: Incomplete

N: Continuing work

NS: No Show

W: Withdrawn

### Repeating Failed Courses

When a student repeats a course after failing to pass it on the first attempt, the grade received on the second attempt shall replace the initial grade in the calculation of the student's GPA upon receipt of a petition from the student. A failed course may be repeated only once. The Academic Support and Records Office must approve requests for a third attempt. If approved and the course is successfully repeated on the third attempt, only one of the previous F grades will be replaced in the calculation of the student's GPA. All attempts are reflected on the student's transcript. A course completed with a passing grade may not be repeated. A student who fails an elective has the option of taking the same course again (if offered) and the student's GPA will be recalculated. The student may take a different elective but it will not count as a repeated course, and the grade will not replace the grade from the failed course. The program is under no obligation to offer electives to allow a student to repeat the elective course that was not successfully completed. A failing grade received as a sanction for a violation of the academic integrity protocol may not be replaced.

### Disputing Grades

If, after completing a course, a student receives a grade that he/she wishes to dispute, the following steps must be taken:

-   A student shall first resolve the grade issue with the instructor.

-   If the issue remains unresolved, the student may submit a written appeal to the appropriate department chairperson.

-   If, after review by the department chairperson, there is still no resolution, the student may submit a formal appeal to the Senior Assistant Dean of Graduate Business Programs.

-   If a change in grade occurs, the instructor will submit the grade change to the Graduate Business Programs Office to be recorded and posted. ***The instructor of record is the only person who can authorize a grade change.***

### Incomplete Grades

An "I" (Incomplete) grade may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the instructor within *three weeks* of the beginning of classes in the next scheduled term (not the student's next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, unless extraordinary circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University registrar within the original three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quarters after the incomplete was assigned, excluding summer session. An incomplete that has not been completed within the specified deadline or has not received an approved extension will be converted to a grade of "F."

### NS (No Show) Grades

The "NS" (No Show) grade is assigned when a student fails to attend and does not drop a course for which he/she has registered. The NS grade does not impact the student's GPA but cannot be changed or removed from the transcript. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mark of "NS" in a class.

### Withdrawn (W) Grades

A "W" (Withdrawn) is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements for dropping a class or withdrawing from the University after the quarter's add/drop period. A mark of "W" cannot be changed to any other grade. A "W" is included in the student's academic record and appears on the student's transcript but has no effect on the student's GPA.

### Registration

Each quarter, a registration period is held to allow all graduate business students to enroll in classes. Students are assigned appointment times in the eCampus system during the designated initial registration period. Appointment times are assigned based on the number of units a student has accumulated plus current enrollment (some exceptions apply). During the initial registration period, students may register for no more than 10 units (does not apply to M.S. students). Upon completion of the initial period, students may add, drop, or swap classes until the end of the first week of classes. Students may drop classes at any time during the quarter until the designated last day to drop classes. (See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter 3.)

Prior to registering for classes, a student must resolve any registration holds that have been placed on his/her student record. To resolve a hold, the appropriate office(s) must be contacted. To navigate the eCampus registration system effectively, students are encouraged to monitor their accounts and clear any holds. Students will not be able to add or swap any classes until their records are clear. New students are encouraged to clear any holds as soon as possible related to pre-program competencies and missing transcripts identified at time of admission.

Once classes have begun, students may withdraw from courses without prior approval up to the seventh week of the quarter. After that date, the student must get approval from the Graduate Business Programs Office. Courses cannot be dropped once the final exam has been administered. (See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter 3.)

### Wait Lists

After the initial registration period, waitlists are used to enroll students during the open enrollment period. Students are allowed to add themselves to the waitlist through eCampus for courses that have reached capacity during the initial registration period. Students who are on waitlists will be enrolled into available spaces provided they do not have time or section conflicts. The student is responsible for monitoring her/his position on the waitlist. Pending no conflicts exist, students will be registered automatically and are responsible for dropping the class if enrolled via waitlist.

At the end of initial registration, classrooms are assigned and capacities are increased accordingly. Once capacities have been increased, the waitlists are scheduled and processed until the day before classes begin. All waitlists are then purged and students can add themselves to a class if space becomes available up until the last day to add a class.

*Note: The only way to enroll in a course is through eCampus. Instructors cannot add students to their class rosters.*

### Leave of Absence

All students who do not register by the end of the first week of any quarter of the academic year, excluding summer quarter, will be placed on the inactive list unless they have been given leaves of absence. A leave of absence request must be made in writing to the Graduate Business Programs Office. If a leave of absence is requested after registration has occurred, the student is responsible for dropping all classes in addition to filing for the leave of absence.

A leave of absence will be granted only for a specified period of time and normally not for more than one year. If the approved period for the leave of absence is exceeded and the student does not contact the Graduate Business Programs Office to request an extension by the end of the first week of the current quarter, the student must re-apply to the program and will be considered for readmission as a new applicant. A leave of absence is not required for students who do not attend summer quarter.

Leaves of absence are included in the six year program completion requirement.

### Program Withdrawal

To withdraw from the University, a written notification must be submitted to the Graduate Business Programs Office. The student is responsible for dropping courses through eCampus separately from withdrawal from the University.

Withdrawal from the University is not officially complete until the student clears obligations with the Bursar's Office. Students on deferments or federal loans also must clear their financial obligations with the Bursar's Office. Refund checks for approved graduate course withdrawals are issued by the Bursar's Office. It is the student's responsibility to contact that office and request disbursement. (See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter 3.)

### Readmittance

A student who does not register for any quarter, excluding summer quarter, and does not apply for a leave of absence, will be placed on the inactive list. When a student is placed on the inactive list, an application for admission accompanied by a reapplication fee of \$148 must be submitted. The student then will be considered for readmission on the same basis as a new applicant. The student also will be required to fulfill any additional requirements and satisfy any curriculum changes the business school may adopt during the interim period between registrations. Credit is not guaranteed for previous completed course work and no further leaves of absence will be allowed.

If the student has attended another school, all transcripts must be sent to the Graduate Business Programs Admissions Committee, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053. All course work taken in the interim must be satisfactorily completed, and the student must be in good standing, in order to be considered for readmission.

### Concurrent Enrollment

A student in the MBA or M.S. Programs will not be allowed concurrent enrollment in Santa Clara University's other academic programs or at any other university. Exceptions are J.D./MBA, J.D./MSIS, 4+1 Programs, and courses taken elsewhere to satisfy pre-program competencies. Once a student has enrolled, no transfer credit for course work done at another university will be granted without permission from the Senior Director, Graduate Business Programs Academic Support and Records. Due to the nature and rigor of the MBA and M.S. Programs, a student's full attention is required to maintain good standing in the program.

### Jesuit Transfer Agreement

Students who leave the Santa Clara area to pursue other work or personal opportunities may participate in the Jesuit Transfer Agreement. Under this agreement, students who have completed 50 percent or more units at SCU may attend another AACSB-accredited MBA Program at one of the participating Jesuit schools and transfer units back to SCU to complete their degrees.

To begin this process, the student must schedule an appointment with the MBA Programs staff to review his/her academic history and discuss the participating school's requirements. Providing the student is in good academic standing and has completed 50 percent or more of the degree requirements at SCU, the degree will be granted by Santa Clara University.

If a student has less than 50 percent of the units required to award an MBA degree at SCU, they may apply to a participating Jesuit school and transfer the units already earned at SCU to that institution. Under this agreement, the student transferring out of Santa Clara University is required to meet all application and admission criteria of the receiving school. Upon admission to the receiving school, students will be informed of which units will be transferred from SCU to the institution. The receiving school will award the degree. Note: This agreement does not apply to Online MBA. For more information [visit http://jesuitmba.org/](http://jesuitmba.org/).

### Courtesy Students

*Incoming*

Students who have been admitted to the Leavey School of Business as visiting students from another AACSB-accredited MBA Program are considered courtesy students. During the application process, courtesy students will be asked to submit a list of pre-approved courses from their sending institution. Upon admission, this list of courses will be kept in the student's file for reference during the registration period. The Graduate Business Programs Office will register all courtesy students for the approved classes on a space-available basis after SCU degree-seeking students have registered.

Once registration has occurred, courtesy students will be responsible for checking their eCampus accounts for billing and tuition information. All bills will be sent to the SCU email address assigned to the courtesy student. Information regarding the billing process can be obtained by contacting the One Stop Enrollment Center.

Upon completion of the courses approved by the sending institution, courtesy student records will be inactivated. Official transcripts are to be requested by the student directly from the Office of the Registrar.

*Outgoing*

Students who need to complete their MBA program outside of SCU, and cannot take advantage of the Jesuit Transfer Agreement, may apply for courtesy student status at another AACSB-accredited MBA Program/Business School. A maximum of six graduate units are allowed for transfer back to Santa Clara University. Courses for transfer must be pre-approved by the Graduate Business Programs Office. Credit will be given for approved coursework completed with a B or better grade and upon receipt of the official transcript.

### Principles for Faculty and Student Conflict of Interest

The Leavey School of Business is committed to the development of good business practices in an open and collaborative environment. The faculty makes a reasonable effort to prevent conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts from developing with enrolled Graduate Business students. The following guidelines apply:

-   The educational purposes within the classroom and University are foremost and supersede commercial interests.

-   Student work is regarded as the intellectual property of the author(s), and written permission must be received prior to use outside the classroom.

-   Neither faculty nor students shall be asked to sign nondisclosure agreements for class-related work.

-   Faculty and students should not expect that any discussion of general or specific economic or organizational matters, or information that is disclosed in the course of that discussion, can be considered confidential, either implicitly or explicitly.

-   Faculty and students should not engage in financial or business relationships with one another while they are teaching and/or enrolled in a course together.

### Petitions and Grievances

Requests for exceptions to Leavey School of Business policies must be made in writing and submitted to the Graduate Business Programs Office. Student grievances regarding courses and policies should be sent to the Graduate Business Programs Office.

### Academic Advising

MBA and M.S. advisors are available as needed for all students. Please contact your program office for dates and availability.

### Curricular Practical Training

Santa Clara University offers international students with F-1 immigration status in the MBA/MSBA/MSIS/MSFA programs the opportunity to engage in Curricular Practical Training in accordance with Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) regulations.

To be eligible to participate in CPT, students should contact the Global Engagement Office. Eligible students will be manually enrolled by their program office.

### Exceptions to Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations

The Bulletin contains the academic and administrative policies and regulations that govern enrollment of students at Santa Clara University. Students are responsible for knowing all academic and administrative policies and regulations affecting their program of study and for abiding by all such policies and regulations during their period of enrollment at the University. Continued enrollment is subject to compliance with the academic and administrative policies and regulations as described herein and otherwise published by the University. Failure to understand the policies and regulations does not relieve a student of his or her responsibility for adhering to the policies and regulations.

The University Registrar is tasked with ensuring that degree requirements, academic program policies and regulations, registration policies and regulations, grading policies and regulations, and academic credit evaluation as described in the Bulletin are implemented appropriately.

On rare occasions, students may request an exception to policy. Requests must be associated with issues or events of an extreme nature that were unforeseen and beyond the control of the student. Poor performance in course work; missed deadlines; change of major or educational plans; or a course grade's adverse effect on the student's grade point average, probationary standing, or other eligibility are not sufficient reasons for granting an exception.

Students should submit their request and the appropriate documentation using the following link: [https://www.scu.edu/registrar/forms/](https://www.scu.edu/registrar/forms/). The Office of the Registrar will review the request for exception with three business days from the date of submission and notify the student of the decision.

***Appealing the Decision of the Office of the Registrar***

A student, who does not agree with the decision of the Registrar, can request an appeal by submitting a formal request for reconsideration to the Office of the Registrar. The request should describe the specific situation and explain the basis of the request for reconsideration. The student should also provide any relevant documentation. All requests for reconsideration must be submitted within ten business days of the original decision of the Office of the Registrar.

Once the request for an appeal is received, the Office of the Registrar will convene a three person panel consisting of an Associate Dean of the relevant College or School, the Dean of Academic Support Services (or designee), and an Associate Dean of Student Life (or designee). The panel will use the general standard that the basis of appeal must be related to issues or events of an extreme nature that were unforeseen and beyond the control of the student. The panel will review requests for exception within fifteen business days from the date of submission and notify the student of the decision within two business days.
