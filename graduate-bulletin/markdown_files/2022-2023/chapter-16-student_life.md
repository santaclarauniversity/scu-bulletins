Leadership Opportunities

### GBP Student Clubs

The purpose of Santa Clara University Graduate Business student organizations is to:

-   Promote, coordinate, and implement student activities

-   Enrich the co-curricular and extracurricular aspects of student life in the Graduate Business Programs

-   Develop and enhance the leadership skills of organization leaders and participants.

GBP student organizations accomplish this by offering graduate business students a variety of opportunities to network with classmates, alumni, and industry professionals through panels and presentations. Students create and lead the clubs with the support, guidance, and direction of the GBP Student Life team. Clubs hold events once a quarter (e.g. Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer) and members are expected to attend at least three of four events during the academic year. All graduate business students are eligible to participate as members in any student club.

Current active student organizations include:

### SCU Culture of Care

As a Jesuit institution, one of our leading values is *cura personalis*, a Latin phrase meaning "care for the whole person". Caring for the personal development of the entire person (emotional, mental, spiritual, physical) is a community effort including support from families, peers, faculty, and staff. As such, when there are indicators that a student may be struggling, it is important that the community come together for aid. SCU CARES embodies the University's commitment to supporting our students by helping them find the resources to build resilience and overcome challenges.

Students can access all of the SCU CARE'S resources via their [webpage](https://www.scu.edu/osl/culture-of-care/for-students/).

Students may use the Office of Student Life [Student of Concern form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?SantaClaraUniv&layout_id=1) to notify staff if they or a fellow student are in need of support and/or resources. These forms can be submitted confidentially.
