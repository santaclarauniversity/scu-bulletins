**Online** **Master of Science in Marketing**
=============================================

The Online Master of Science in Marketing master (OMSM) program has been designed in the heart of Silicon Valley to help students grow into a visionary leader conversant in the burgeoning field of marketing technology, or "MarTech." MarTech describes the applications, interfaces, and tracking technologies that leading-edge marketing organizations use to operate with agility and solve the impossible-seeming marketing problems that arise in the contemporary digital world. Coursework for the MS in Marketing emphasizes all aspects of MarTech, from analytics and customer behavior tracking to social media integration and digital content strategy.

Powerful digital marketing tools demand responsible leaders who will use them ethically, with respect for consumer protection and privacy. With help from Santa Clara University\'s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, we develop thought-provoking discussions of data collection, customer privacy, and other hot-button marketing issues with global impact today. Students will graduate from the Master\'s in Marketing instilled with the values and perspective necessary to lead the right way in Silicon Valley and beyond.

Academic Standing
-----------------

To remain in good academic standing, MS Marketing students must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in all work taken in the Leavey School of Business. A grade of C- is considered a minimum passing grade in each course. A grade of F is considered a failing grade, and the units will not be counted toward graduation requirements.

If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0, he/she will be placed on academic probation. A student then has one quarter to raise the GPA to a cumulative 3.0 or they will be dismissed from the program. Students failing required classes may be dismissed immediately if it is mathematically impossible to return to good standing and remain on track to graduate with his/her class.

The administration will contact faculty midway through the term to acquire a status update on academic performance to ensure students are aware of academic resources and tutoring in an attempt to resolve matters before they affect GPA.

If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0 at the end of his/her final quarter and all course requirements have been satisfied, no degree will be awarded until the cumulative GPA is a 3.0 or better through completion of additional graduate course work in the Leavey School of Business.
