MBA and STEM MBA Curriculum
===========================

*Note: Refer to designated chapters for curriculum details specific to the Masters of Science in Information Systems, Finance & Analytics, Business Analytics, Executive MBA, and Online Programs.*

The Santa Clara MBA program is designed to develop leaders with a broad business, economic, and social perspective who are capable of managing change in dynamic environments. Students develop a breadth of understanding through coursework in accounting, economics, finance, management, marketing, and operations management and information systems; and depth by concentrating electives in functional cross-disciplinary areas.

Program Design
--------------

The design of the curriculum was guided by several overarching goals:

1.  Provide students with the skills and bodies of knowledge that support successful, fulfilling careers in business.

2.  Alignment with LSB's primary point of distinction: Engagement with Silicon Valley.

3.  Strong content related to Entrepreneurship and Innovation (in both new and established firms) and blending theory and practice to help students put ideas into action.

4.  Commitment to the Jesuit ideals of ethics, integrity and corporate and individual social responsibility.

Overview of Curriculum
----------------------

The Santa Clara MBA curriculum consists of 70 units across 14 core courses (44 units) and 26 additional units of free electives. While entering students have a recommended schedule for their first year, there is considerable flexibility in the pace and order in which courses are taken (with the caveat that all prerequisites must be satisfied before enrolling in a particular course). Please note that the Evening MBA and Online MBA programs follow the same curriculum and requirements.

The STEM MBA program follows the same 70 unit curriculum and course schedules as the MBA program and has been designated as a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and reflects a curricular focus on business skills with an emphasis on STEM applications. To complete the STEM MBA, a minimum of 12 elective units must be selected from the STEM-approved courses listed in the Data Science and Business Analytics concentration.

Schedules
---------

During the fall, winter, spring, and summer quarters, 4-unit classes generally meet twice per week for ten weeks for 95 minutes per session. The 2-unit courses generally meet twice per week for five weeks covering the first or second half of a quarter. Some elective courses are scheduled for weekend sessions throughout the term. In all quarters, final exam periods are two hours.

### Free Elective Courses (26 Units)

Elective courses expand a student's knowledge in areas of particular interest or importance to the student's career and educational goals. Electives may be taken any time during the program, assuming the prerequisite coursework is complete. Electives can also be used to earn a concentration in a particular area. Any course offered in conjunction with the MBA program, with the exception of those otherwise required, is considered an elective. For descriptions of elective courses, please consult Chapter 12. New courses are continually being developed and all elective options may not be listed.

### Independent Study

A student may elect to register for independent study to fulfill an elective requirement (2 or 4 units). Independent study courses are numbered 3698 (e.g., OMIS 3698, MGMT 3698, etc.). A student may take only one independent study course during their program. To obtain permission to register for independent study, students should prepare a complete proposal at least one quarter in advance of the quarter in which they wish to undertake the study. The proposal must be reviewed and signed by a tenured faculty member who thereby agrees to supervise and evaluate the study. The proposal is then reviewed by the department chair who must approve the proposal. The proposal must then be submitted to the Graduate Business Programs Office for final review. A signed copy of the proposal must be on file with the Graduate Business Programs Office before registration. An independent study is graded in the same manner as all other courses.

Concentrations
--------------

Santa Clara University's MBA program has a general management perspective but also provides an option for students to complete a concentration. Pending completion of all required courses, the awarded concentration will appear on the student's official degree transcript. It does not appear on the student's diploma.

A student is required to declare their intended concentration **during or before the term in which they reach 52 completed program units**. The concentration declaration form can be found on the [Student Services website](https://www.scu.edu/business/graduate-degrees/student-services/academic/forms/).

Concentrations require at least 12 elective units in a specific area, and coursework completed outside of Santa Clara University does not satisfy concentration requirements. See below for more information.

MBA Anywhere Program
--------------------

The SCU Anywhere Program allows students to take electives, on-campus or online, from another Master's program. This applies to the Evening MBA, Online MBA, Online MS in Marketing, Online MS in Finance and Analytics, and Online Business Analytics Programs. The SCU Anywhere Program will offer greater flexibility and course availability for all Online and Evening MBA students. Students may take up to 16-units of elective credit in another program. Tuition fees will be based on the student's original program.

**Evening MBA students** must complete an online student success seminar before they begin their first online course. Students will have access to the online student success seminar approximately 4 - 6 weeks before the course begins. Online courses are **asynchronous**, structured with weekly modules, and students login at their convenience to complete their coursework. For all courses, Module 0 provides an overview of each course (including the syllabus) and opens the Friday before the first day of instruction. Students may access the full course beginning on the first day of class. Online courses will take place at [http://onlinelearning.scu.edu/](http://onlinelearning.scu.edu/). If you encounter technical difficulties, call 833-822-2276 or email mba@scu.edu.

**Online students** must use a separate Camino tile for on-campus courses. Do not access it via [https://onlinelearning.scu.edu](https://onlinelearning.scu.edu/). Instead, access it through the Camino tile via [SCU's Single Sign-On Portal](https://www.scu.edu/apps/login/).

Curricular Practical Training
