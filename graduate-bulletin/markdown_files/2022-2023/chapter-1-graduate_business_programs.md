Graduate Business Programs
==========================

Statement of Purpose
--------------------

Santa Clara University's Business School develops students of competence, conscience, and compassion who can provide leadership in technologically advanced and rapidly changing global environments. The development of competence is reflected in our commitment to teaching excellence and the scholarly research necessary to animate instruction and foster the creation of knowledge. The development of conscience is enhanced through an emphasis on reflective inquiry that is both professionally rigorous and ethically sound. Compassion is at the intersection of competence conscience, and is fostered through an appreciation of multiple perspectives and recognition of the human being as part of every equation.

Mission Statement of the Graduate Business Programs Office
----------------------------------------------------------

The Santa Clara University Graduate Business Programs team strives to provide a transformative student-centered experience by being supportive, compassionate, and inclusive at all points in a student's educational journey. We aspire to create student success with opportunities to network with faculty, fellow students, and alumni. With collaboration across career, program, and admissions teams, GBP will enable students to be socially conscious, ethically minded, and those who understand how to lead themselves and others.

Professional Orientation
------------------------

The Graduate Business Programs at Santa Clara University are designed specifically to meet the needs and concerns of working professionals. To allow students to pursue their graduate business degrees while continuing their careers, classes are scheduled in the evening or on weekends. The curriculum blends instruction in theory with practical applications, enriched by faculty experts (who engage in state-of-the- art research or have deep industry experience) and students whose curiosity is informed by real-life organizational concerns.

Academic Standards
------------------

Santa Clara's Graduate Business Programs have a reputation for quality, providing both academic rigor and practical relevance. Admission standards are selective, as courses are demanding and both faculty and fellow students have high expectations, although the atmosphere is still collegial and not competitive. While the MBA and MS degrees are considered final professional degrees, we look to admit students focused on receiving an education, not simply a piece of paper, for their time and effort. Students should be prepared for an intensive course of study encompassing all the major functional and disciplinary areas and involving both quantitative and qualitative skills. Similarly, students pursuing an MS degree should expect rigorous and relevant coursework, but with a more narrowly defined domain. Regardless the program, students demonstrating curiosity, engagement, and a collaborative spirit reap the greatest benefits.

Accreditation
-------------

Santa Clara University was in the original group of MBA programs in 1961 accredited by AACSB International--the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The AACSB is the specialized accrediting organization that conducts periodic in-depth reviews of business schools to ensure that their curricula, faculty, and students meet the highest standards of excellence. Re-accredited in 2021, Santa Clara's program has consistently met the high standards of the AACSB. Less than 10% of the world's 13,000 business programs have earned AACSB Accreditation. Santa Clara is also accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). Such regional accreditation is a prerequisite for the specialized program accreditation provided by AACSB International.

Student Body
------------

Approximately 850 students are enrolled in the MBA and M.S. Programs. Entering MBA students represent a variety of undergraduate and graduate fields of study. MBA students, on average, have 8 years of work experience at time of admission. The average grade point average of entering MBA students is 3.3, and the average GMAT score is 620. This blend of academic backgrounds and work experience provides opportunities for enhanced learning both in and out of the classroom.

Many of our MBA students are working professionals -- people who work full time in local companies and take three to four courses each quarter. Students come from more than 500 organizations that comprise a list of Silicon Valley's most vibrant businesses. Additionally, many of our M.S. students are international students who add to the diversity of our community. Our Online Programs have students from over 10 different states enrolled in the program.
