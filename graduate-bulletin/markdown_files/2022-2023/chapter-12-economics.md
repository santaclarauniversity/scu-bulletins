Economics Curriculum
--------------------

### **ECON 2504**. **Microeconomics with Econometric Applications**

Topics include the characteristics of costs and demand and profit maximization pricing. Market structures are studied with a focus on differences and the concomitant consequences for business decisions. Students will understand the various market structures in the context of the global trade environment. Regression analysis is used to rigorously estimate costs and demands. Open to MSBA students only. *Prerequisite: working knowledge of calculus.* (4 units)

### ECON 2509/2409. Econometrics with R

Econometrics is the application of data analysis and statistics to economic and business questions. In this 2-unit course you will learn the basic conceptual foundations and tools of econometrics and apply them to real-world data. The key statistical technique used in this course is multiple linear regression, a powerful tool for estimating the impact of one or more hypothesized causal variables on an outcome of interest while controlling for other factors. These econometric tools will help you translate qualitative statements developed in theory into quantitative ones. Open to MSBA/MSFA students only. *Prerequisite: MSIS 2506.* (4 units)

### ECON 3000. Managerial Economics

This course will introduce the economics foundation for managerial decisions. The course analyzes the economic behavior of individuals and firms and explores how their interactions in markets affect managerial decisions. Basic concepts of market, price elasticity, theory of consumer and theory of firm will be studied to incorporate economic theories in managerial decision making. How key managerial decisions are made in different industrial structures will be discussed. *Prerequisites: OMIS 3202.* (4 units)

### ECON 3052. The Economics of Innovation and Intellectual Property

This course provides a helicopter tour of the economics of innovation and intellectual property. The objective of the course is to offer students an overview of some of the most topical, relevant (from a business and policy perspective), and interesting topics surrounding innovation and intellectual property. The course covers in particular recent events related to intellectual property, such as the debate on software patents, "patent wars", patent litigation involving patent trolls, and standard essential patents. It also introduces students to the economics of other intellectual property rights, including trademarks, copyright, and design rights. The course material varies substantially across topics; it is both theoretical and empirical and cuts across a number of disciplines, most importantly law and economics. Open to MBA students only. *Prerequisite: Taken in the last quarter of the program*. (2 units)

### ECON 3402. Macroeconomics in the Global Economy, Theory, Empirics and Policy

The macroeconomic and global economic environment in which businesses operate can profoundly influence firm performance. This course helps managers understand the determinants of national output, income, and expenditure, employment and unemployment, inflation, interest rates, financial crises, international movements of capital, exchange rates, and many other macroeconomic variables. Economic models are utilized to explain how these variables are interrelated and to predict how they change over time, enabling managers to make well-informed decisions important to the success of their businesses. The course has a strong empirical component and utilizes economic data extensively to examine recent and historical economic events to illustrate how the models work. Emphasis is placed on the role of government policy (fiscal, monetary, and regulatory) in promoting economic growth, reducing the output loss and unemployment associated with recessions, controlling inflation, preventing or mitigating the consequences of financial crises, and reducing the international linkages among countries in goods and financial markets, including the determinants of exchange rates, the current and capital account balances, and international debt. *Prerequisites: ECON 3000*. (4 units)

### ECON 3430. Game Theory and Strategic Behavior

Studies theoretical concepts and tools for analyzing issues in the business environment such as conflict, bargaining, pretending and shirking in organizations and markets, agenda construction, and strategic commitment. Teaches game theoretical topics such as Nash-equilibrium, Sub game perfection, Bayesian Nash-equilibrium, Harsanyi transformation, commitment, and Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium. *Prerequisites: ECON 3000*. (4 units)

### ECON 3431. Dynamic Macroeconomics

This course provides an introduction to: analytical and numerical tools for dynamic optimization; quantitative analysis of business cycle using the neoclassical growth theory; monetary policy analysis and projection using new Keynesian models; social security and inter-generational transfers; and other selected topics of economic dynamics. Open to MBA students only. *Prerequisite: Econ 3000*. (2 units)

### ECON 3436. Applied Time Series Analysis

This course focuses on economic forecasting. Many decisions made in business, economics, finance and government depend on the forecasts that are constantly generated in these and other disciplines. This course will introduce the students to econometric time-series models and methods that can be used to generate forecasts. A wide range of topics will be covered, including basic concepts of time-series forecasting, trends and seasonality, ARIMA processes, and evaluation of forecasts. Illustrative examples applying these techniques to actual data will be presented in class, and students will perform a variety of data analyses on the computer. Upon completion of this course, students will have mastered basic properties of time-series forecasting models, and be able to skillfully select appropriate forecasting models to fit real world data sets and generate their own forecasts. *Prerequisites: ECON 3400 and ECON 3402 or ECON 3000*. (3 units)
