          <hr> <body class="doc-content"><h1><span class=" gdbold">Executive MBA Program</span></h1><p><span>The Executive MBA program offers an accelerated path to the degree for experienced managers. The program is organized around cross-functional themes focusing on contemporary business challenges. Tailored to meet the needs of Silicon Valley executives, all aspects of the curriculum center on issues of substantive and pragmatic concern. In particular, coursework and assignments are constructed to integrate current work challenges students face. Highlights of the program include degree completion in 20 months, a Friday/Saturday biweekly schedule, and a rigorous curriculum that meets Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International (AACSB) requirements.</span></p><p><span>Students have the opportunity to connect with Silicon Valley companies that are globally renowned for being on the forefront of business practices. The design places great emphasis on innovation throughout the curriculum. A series of targeted co-curricular workshops and local, national, and international immersion experiences are key components of the program.</span></p><h2 id="h.7h5utb2ie10i"><span class=" gdbold">Admissions</span></h2><p><span>To be admitted to the Executive MBA program, the applicant must have at least ten years of full-time work experience and a record of accomplishment leading people, projects, or programs. Strong applicants will be those who already hold the kind of leadership positions that many people attending conventional MBA programs hope to attain. Successful applicants also will show a high degree of academic aptitude as measured by prior coursework. Knowledge of basic statistics is a program prerequisite; however, no prior business education is necessary. Admission is in the fall term only.</span></p><p><span>All degree requirements for the Executive MBA must be completed within six years of initial enrollment. Leaves of absence and periods of non-enrollment count toward this six-year limit. Coursework completed prior to a break in enrollment is not automatically transferable toward the degree after re-entry. Students who re-enroll are subject to the curriculum and degree requirements stated in the Graduate Business Programs Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entry. </span></p><h2 id="h.k994oin4of54"><span class=" gdbold">Policies and Procedures</span></h2><p><span>Executive MBA students must adhere to the policies and procedures described in this bulletin. Please refer to Chapter 3 in this bulletin for all GBP tuition and refund policies. Students should also know that the Executive MBA is a lockstep based program, which means short-term leaves of absence aren’t allowed. If a student needs to take a leave, they would need to formally withdraw from the program and rejoin with the next available cohort to resume where they left off.</span></p><p><span>All student lodging, meals, and on-site transportation expenses for immersion and residency programs are included in the cost of tuition. Students are responsible for costs incurred for travel to immersion and residency programs, including flights, gas and/or mileage on personal vehicles, and incidental expenses. </span></p><h2 id="h.vr4mt5fvsrch"><span class=" gdbold">Course Descriptions</span></h2><p><span>The following is a detailed description of the Executive MBA curriculum. The total program requirement is 62 units, comprising 56 core units, including two residency weekends, 6 units of electives; 4 off-campus immersion trips; and 14 workshops. This curriculum is also hybrid with one weekend of class on campus and the other remote.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2 id="h.nfot4x354y8j"><span class=" gdbold">Mini Term</span></h2><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Executive Communications Workshop</span></p><p><span>This interactive, improv-based workshop will teach critical business communication skills including spontaneity, thinking on your feet, collaboration, listening, executive presence, and storytelling. Although the workshop is based on improv techniques and skills, students will not be performing improv. Working mostly in small groups, participants will learn to increase their agility; grow their confidence in unpredictable situations; be more present and open to surprising ideas; tell engaging stories; and cultivate a mindset of curiosity to quickly connect with all types of stakeholders. </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Innovation Training Workshop</span></p><p><span>In this workshop, students will learn the Competing Values Framework, one of the most powerful frameworks for creating value and innovating, and will identify their personal strengths as well as how to complement their strengths with those of others. Working in teams to tackle live innovation challenges, students will deepen and refine their skills in human-centered innovation, starting with the "fuzzy front-end" of innovation all the way through prototyping and user testing. The students will improve their ability to reduce the uncertainty and risk inherent in innovative opportunities.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Executive Decision-Making Workshop</span></p><p><span>Students will learn to diagnose and address the human, organizational, political, and cultural factors and forces that make executive decision-making difficult. This full-day workshop is highly interactive and will allow students to practice their decision-making skills in real time.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h3 id="h.meyof0xkebmj"><span class=" gdbold">EMBA 900 Leadership in Dynamic Environments</span></h3><p><span>The program begins with a three-day residential weekend taught by Dr. Barry Posner, an internationally renowned leadership expert. In this intensive weekend seminar, students receive 360-degree feedback about themselves as leaders, learn about and develop skills related to the practices of exemplary leaders, and determine action plans for improving themselves as leaders back in their workplaces. The weekend also helps orient students to setting personal goals, working effectively in small groups, and expanding their learning processes. (3 units)</span></p><h2 id="h.7i61xdz0pex9"><span class=" gdbold">Quarter 1</span></h2><h3 id="h.6guuhg7d0qx0"><span class=" gdbold">EMBA 901 Strategic Management</span></h3><p><span>Strategy is inherently dynamic. This course focuses on the processes by which managers position their businesses to create and sustain an advantage relative to rivals in the face of uncertainty, rapid change, and competition. Strategy involves understanding the utility of different choices and tradeoffs- choosing what not to do is as important as choosing what to do. As a result, the course will expose you to frameworks and concepts for analyzing a firm's environment and competitive position to inform the strategic decision-making process. By uncovering the factors that make some strategic positions strong and viable, we shall develop the ability to evaluate the effects of changes in resources &amp; capabilities, industry forces, macro-environmental forces, and technology on industry structure and firm behavior and, in turn, on a firm's opportunities for creating, capturing and sustaining superior profits relative to rivals. (4 units)</span></p><h3 id="h.wh75f875zupd"><span class=" gdbold"></span></h3><h3 id="h.x79lekaheozy"><span class=" gdbold">EMBA 902 Managing Organizations &amp; Teams</span></h3><p><span>Regardless of your particular industry, functional role, or technical expertise, as you advance in your career, your time will increasingly focus on managing, motivating, and communicating with individuals and teams in your workplace- and on designing jobs, reward systems, and entire organizations for accomplishing these tasks. Indeed, organizational leaders estimate that they can spend up to 30% of their time focusing on interpersonal issues. This course is concerned with understanding the behavior that takes place within organizations to help you become a more influential leader and to increase the effectiveness of both you and your organization. It focuses on helping you better understand the nature and dynamics of social behavior as they relate to performance in real-world business settings, and draws heavily on research from the fields of psychology, social psychology, and sociology. Using a combination of case analyses, videos, exercises, and field projects, the course relates existing theory and research in the social sciences to organizations by reviewing basic concepts about interpersonal, team, and organizational behavior. (3 units)</span></p><h3 id="h.uo4mfhez4eu3"><span class=" gdbold"></span></h3><h3 id="h.z5jvhgtet8xv"><span class=" gdbold">Leading with Improv Workshop</span></h3><p><span>Oak and Reeds’ team collaboration workshops teach specific techniques designed to improve collaboration in in-person, virtual, or hybrid settings. In this workshop, we'll work on gaining confidence, “thinking on your feet,” and sharing ideas with minimal preparation time. We'll practice mental techniques for  “turning down the censor” to in order to embrace the unexpected, deter snap judgments, and let creative ideas flourish.

This course introduces the roles, concepts, legal requirements, and impacts of financial reporting. We cover the basic financial statements and the analysis and recording of transactions, with a focus on interpretations of reported results. By the end of this course, students should be able to demonstrate a specific working knowledge of the following course objectives: The impact on accounting of a changing regulatory environment, globalization, and politics, including the role of the SEC and international standard setters; The accrual basis of accounting, including the double entry accounting system for recording business transactions and adjustments, as well as the key issues in the timing and recording of revenues and expenses; The application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), an introduction to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and how GAAP is used to prepare, explain and analyze the primary financial statements; The ability to perform a financial analysis and make investment and lending decisions using a set of corporate financial statements.

We will cover probabilistic thinking and the fundamentals of statistical analysis. Specific attention will be paid to the process of quantifying seemingly ambiguous managerial situations and working through those situations using a combination of algebraic and graphical visual analysis. Finally, the concept of optimization will be introduced as a basic operating principle of business, viewed through the lens of elementary calculus. Excel will be used as the primary tool for all hands-on work.</span></p><h2 id="h.pj18s4pkutdq"><span class=" gdbold">Quarter 2</span></h2><h3 id="h.ojaahjbsj4ws"><span class=" gdbold">EMBA 903 Analytics</span></h3><p><span>A recent EMBA student noted, "Knowledge of analytics will be table stakes in just a few years." For this reason, we have made Analytics one of the major pillars of our business curriculum. This course does not aspire to produce data scientists; more often, our executive graduates will have responsibility for how much and what kind of data to use, analytics technology selection, interpretation of findings, and how to perform the human intervention that remains necessary until we are prepared to let machines directly call the shots. These tasks require balancing considerations such as the accuracy of the algorithms, time and cost of computing, interpretability of outputs, and susceptibility to bias. But competence at making these tradeoffs is simply not attainable without at some point examining the math and accruing hands-on practice. To that end, we will study the technical details enough to develop an instinct about whether the outputs make sense, and we will use data and software in every session. Our specific technical content will be the foundation upon which every cutting-edge Machine Learning AI application is built: statistics and mathematical optimization. Students will learn to take a dataset (e.g., attributes of past customers) and explore it numerically and visually. They will use this to create models that predict something about the next customer (e.g., how much will this customer spend?). Students will then construct models that can recommend a course of action, accounting for constraints on the allowable actions (e.g., due to resource limitations) and the consequences of the actions (e.g., profit margins).

This course helps managers understand the determinants of national output, income, and expenditure, employment and unemployment, inflation, interest rates, financial crises, international movements of capital, exchange rates, and many other macroeconomic variables. Economic models are utilized to explain how these variables are interrelated and to predict how they change over time, enabling managers to make well-informed decisions important to the success of their businesses. The course has a strong empirical component and utilizes economic data extensively to examine recent and historical economic events to illustrate how the models work. Emphasis is placed on the role of government policy (fiscal, monetary, and regulatory) in promoting economic growth, reducing the output loss and unemployment associated with recessions, controlling inflation, preventing or mitigating the consequences of financial crises, and reducing inequality. The course stresses the importance of the global economy to U.S. businesses and covers the international linkages among countries in goods and financial markets, including the determinants of exchange rates, the current and capital account balances, and international debt.

It is charged with focusing on the customer, providing value, and recapturing value for the firm. Strategic marketing management involves determining which customers an organization should serve by analyzing customer needs, segmenting the market by selecting a target segment, and then determining the 4Ps (Product, Pricing, Promotion, and Place) for the chosen segment. Product managers, channel leaders, sales leaders, and CMOs are some of the stakeholders involved in this process. Today's marketers have an increasing amount of data available to them and the modern practice of marketing involves effectively using this data to inform decision making. This course provides information necessary for an experienced executive to develop a working knowledge of marketing. Going beyond the fundamental 4Ps of marketing the course also introduces the rigorous lens of the three C's---the customer, competitors, and the company. The course also emphasizes data-driven marketing and the idea that customers are heterogeneous in their needs.

What price we want to pay, how much we want to be paid, who will do the dishes, all of these are negotiations. Yet, although people negotiate all the time, most know very little about the strategy and psychology of effective negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way whereas other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire? Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. It is a craft that must hold cooperation and competition in creative tension. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. Largely experiential, the course will provide you with the opportunity to develop your skills by participating in negotiations and integrating your experiences with the principles presented in the assigned readings and course discussions.
