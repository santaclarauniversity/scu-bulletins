<p>The online marketing master&apos;s degree program has been designed in the heart of Silicon Valley to help you grow into a visionary leader conversant in the burgeoning field of marketing technology, or &quot;MarTech.&quot; MarTech describes the applications, interfaces, and tracking technologies that leading-edge marketing organizations use to operate with agility and solve the impossible-seeming marketing problems that arise in the contemporary digital world. Coursework for the Online MS in Marketing emphasizes all aspects of MarTech, from analytics and customer behavior tracking to social media integration and digital content strategy. Powerful digital marketing tools demand responsible leaders who will use them ethically, with respect for consumer protection and privacy. With help from Santa Clara University\&apos;s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, we develop thought-provoking discussions of data collection, customer privacy, and other hot-button marketing issues with global impact today. Students will graduate from the Online Master\&apos;s in Marketing instilled with the values and perspective necessary to lead the right way in Silicon Valley and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="admissions-contingencies">Admissions Contingencies</h2>
<p>Applicants may be admitted with one or more contingencies. All contingencies are documented on the student&apos;s Program Plan Card which is provided to the student at the time of admission. All contingencies must be fulfilled by the end of the student&apos;s first term in residence.

<p>Admissions decisions are made throughout the year.

Once accepted, a non refundable tuition deposit is required prior to registration. The deposit is applied toward the student&apos;s first-term tuition.</p>
<h2 id="academic-standing">Academic Standing</h2>
<p>To qualify for the MS Marketing degree, a student must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in all work taken in the Leavey School of Business. A grade of C- is considered a minimum passing grade in each course. A grade of F is considered a failing grade, and the units will not be counted toward graduation requirements.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0, he/she will be placed on academic probation. A student then has one quarter to raise the GPA to a cumulative 3.0 or they will be dismissed from the program. Students failing required classes may be dismissed immediately if it is mathematically impossible to return to good standing and remain on track to graduate with his/her class.</p>
<p>The administration will contact faculty midway through the term to acquire a status update on academic performance to ensure students are aware of academic resources and tutoring in an attempt to resolve matters before they affect GPA.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0 at the end of his/her final quarter and all course requirements have been satisfied, no degree will be awarded until the cumulative GPA is a 3.0 or better through completion of additional graduate course work in the Leavey School of Business.</p>
<h2 id="student-responsibility">Student Responsibility</h2>
<p>Students enrolled in the MS Marketing program are required to follow the same policies and procedures as students in the evening MBA program. Each student is personally responsible for knowing all of the academic regulations of the graduate business school. This includes, but is not limited to: grading, honor code, leave of absence, withdrawal, and concurrent enrollment policies.

Yet many Silicon Valley marketers rely only on technology, attributes and/or price and overlook the strategic and tactical benefits that a well-managed brand provides. Achieving Brand Leadership provides a framework and tools for marketers to successfully brand products and services and add an additional layer of advantage with in the competitive environment. The course defines and examines the concept of branding through a theoretical and conceptual framework and in number of business contexts. Beginning with a fundamental review of the core branding elements, we weigh the importance of both the promise and the experience aspects of branding in building and sustaining trust. An examination of brand measurements illuminates the power of metrics and highlights different aspects of branding strategies. A look at past cases of successful and unsuccessful branding brings out variations in approaches to such issues as master brands, sub-brands, and the branding of services. Finally, the impact of branding architectures and creative positioning on brand equity are considered. The course will use both management readings and current articles to provide a solid foundation for analysis. A series of cases drawn from both the product and service arenas will enable students to apply this analytical framework to actual situations. Brand equity and its related metrics provide a standard basis in evaluating various strategies for establishing and growing brands. A final individual course project offers an opportunity to integrate various facets of branding for a specific product or service. </p>

The course prepares graduates to create, analyze and manage an internet-based business. Prerequisites are MKTG 3000.  The objective of this course is to provide an in-depth introduction to the topic of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. These algorithms are based on the theory of Dynamic Programming and Markov Decision Processes, which originated more than fifty years ago. But in recent years, the use of Deep Learning algorithms to RL systems, known as Deep Reinforcement Learning, has led to big gains in performance for applications such in Robotics, Quantitative Finance and Game Playing systems. In the first half of the course we start by discussing Markov Decision Processes, DynamicProgramming algorithms and the concept of Value Functions. We introduce the idea of Reinforcement Learning as a way to do optimal control in cases when a system model is not available and information about the Value Function is obtained by analyzing its sample paths. RL Algorithms such as Monte Carlo based learning, Temporal Difference Learningand Q-Learning are discussed in detail. Concepts such as on-policy and off-policy learning, policy exploration vs exploitation are also explained. In the second half of the course we introduce the idea of using Deep Learning NeuralNetworks as function approximators for RL systems, which leads to a large increase in the complexity of systems that can be handled using RL. The Deep Q Network (DQN)algorithm is discussed in detail. We then discuss Policy Gradient methods such as the REINFORCE algorithm, and then combine Value Function and Policy Gradient methods together and come up with Actor-Critic Algorithms. We also discuss Model based RL, which results in the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Applications of these  concepts in the areas of Game Playing systems, Finance and Robotics are also discussed.</p>
