<p><strong>Annual Graduate student health insurance</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Santa Clara University requires all degree seeking students enrolled at least half-time in their school or college to have health insurance (excluding certificate and online programs)</em>.</strong> This requirement helps to protect against unexpected high medical costs and provides access to quality health care.</p>

Students with comparable health insurance must complete the Online Waiver Form with their own insurance information.

<p>Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrolling at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures. Students may designate a third party (e.g. spouse) to be an authorized user for their student account. That individual is authorized by the student to have access to his/her billing statements and to make payments on the student&apos;s behalf. However, it is still the student&apos;s responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the published deadlines. Authorized Users do not have access to any other student account information via this website.</p>
<p>Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through University eCampus. A billing notification will be sent to the student&apos;s assigned SCU gmail account and to the e-mail address of any Authorized User. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remittance. In compliance with FERPA, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, Santa Clara University is prohibited from providing your student financial and non-directory academic information to a third party including parents, spouse, guardian, etc., without a release. This information includes, but is not limited to, all student billing items, awarded financial aid, enrollment status and various student financial or academic information. Enter FERPA information through eCampus. Log into ecampus, click the Academic tile, click FERPA release.</p>
<p>Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees associated with their enrollment status by the published term payment deadline. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to pre-pay for tuition before enrollment is granted. <strong>Registered students who do not withdraw formally from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their accounts as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees.</strong></p>

<h3 id="payment-methods">Payment Methods</h3>
<p><em>Santa Clara University offers a variety of payment methods to students to assist with their financial obligations:</em></p>
<p><strong>Payment by Electronic Check</strong></p>
<p>A student or authorized user may make online payments by authorizing a fund transfer directly from his/her personal checking or savings account through a third-party website accessible via the University eCampus system. The payer is able to make electronic check payments online without incurring a transaction fee.</p>
<p><strong>Payment by Mail</strong></p>
<p>Payment by personal or cashier&apos;s check for student account charges can be mailed to the University&apos;s cash management service lockbox. The payer should download a copy of the students&apos; billing statement, enclose it with the payment written to Santa Clara University, and mail both items to : SCU Payment Processing, PO Box 550, Santa Clara CA 95052-0550.</p>
<p><strong>Payment In Person</strong></p>
<p>Payments for student account charges may be made in person by personal/cashier&apos;s check, money order or cash at the Enrollment Services Center in the Admissions &amp; Enrollment Services Building. There are computer kiosks located in the Enrollment Services Center for the convenience of students and payers to make online payments. The University does not accept debit or credit card payments for student account charges.</p>
<p><strong>International Payment by Wire Transfer</strong></p>
<p>International students may submit payment quickly and securely by going to Flywire at <a href="http://www.flywire.com/pay/scu" target="_blank">[www.flywire.com/pay/scu]</a>. Students are able to benefit from excellent exchange rates and payment can usually be made in the student&apos;s home currency.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p>
<p>Currently enrolled students are eligible to enroll in a monthly payment plan to assist with budgeting needs. The online <em>only</em> monthly payment plan can be accessed by logging into eCampus and selecting the Financial Account Tile. There is a non-refundable enrollment fee each quarter but no interest is charged during the payment term. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar&apos;s Office website: <a href="http://www.scu.edu/bursar/paymentoptions/paymentplan" target="_blank">[www.scu.edu/bursar]</a></p>
<h3 id="delinquent-payments">Delinquent Payments</h3>
<p>If all charges on a student&apos;s account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement by the payment deadline, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student&apos;s account and a hold will be placed on the student&apos;s record. A hold on a student&apos;s record prevents the release of transcripts or diplomas, access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default, in accordance with California state law.</p>
<p>Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recovering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be <strong>paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University.</strong></p>
<h3 id="refunds-for-credit-balances">Refunds for Credit Balances</h3>
<p>Refunds will be granted only for student accounts reflecting a credit balance. A refund will not be granted based on anticipated aid. All financial aid must be disbursed on to a student&apos;s account before a refund is processed. It is the student&apos;s responsibility to make sure all necessary documentation is complete and submitted to the Financial Aid Office so that aid can be disbursed properly and in a timely fashion. Payment received by personal check will have a 14 calendar day hold before a refund can be issued; electronic check payments require a 7 calendar day hold. Additional information related to refunds can be found on the Bursar&apos;s website: <a href="http://www.scu.edu/bursar" target="_blank">[www.scu.edu/bursar]</a> .</p>
<h3 id="billing-disputes">Billing Disputes</h3>
<p>If a student wishes to dispute any charges on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar&apos;s Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar&apos;s Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the the item in question appeared. Communication can be made by telephone, but doing so will not preserve the student&apos;s rights.</p>
<p>Communication should include the student&apos;s name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress; all other items not in question must be paid by the due date. If the amount in question is found to be correct, payment must be submitted to the Bursar&apos;s Office immediately upon notification.</p>
<h2 id="tuition-refund-policy">Tuition Refund Policy</h2>
<p>Students who formally withdraw from the University or drop courses are eligible for tuition refunds in accordance with the policies outlined below. No refunds are made for registration fees, student activity fees, course audit fees, or other miscellaneous fees..</p>
<p>The effective date used for the determination of any tuition refund is the date on which notification of withdrawal is received by the student&apos;s respective Records Office or the date in which the student drops his or her course online--not the last date of attendance. Students who fail to drop a course, even if they do not attend, or fail to notify the University of their intent to withdraw, regardless of the reason, will be responsible to pay all tuition and fee charges.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="financial-hardship">Financial Hardship</h3>
<p>Students who withdraw from the University or drop courses due to an illness, injury, or psychological/emotional condition are eligible for a tuition refund in accordance with the schedule above. Tuition insurance may be purchased to cover tuition charges for medical or emotional related withdrawals that occur after the first week of the term.</p>
<p>Santa Clara University degree students who withdraw from the University or who are administratively withdrawn from the University after the third week of the term due to a qualifying financial hardship may be eligible for an allocation from the student hardship fund for 25 percent of the tuition charges for that term. Qualifying financial hardships include: (1) death, disabling injury, medical emergency, (2) loss of job by an independent student, (3) medical or other emergency involving a dependent of an independent student, and (4) student deployment for active military duty. The Vice Provost for Student Life or designee, in consultation with the Financial Aid Office, will determine qualifying financial hardships and any allocation from the student hardship fund. Students must submit a request for an allocation from the student hardship fund by the end of the applicable term.</p>
<p>No tuition refunds are made because of curtailed services resulting from strikes, acts of God, civil insurrection, riots or threats thereof, or other causes beyond the control of the University.</p>

Dewar Inc. This low cost plan is designed to protect from loss of funds paid for tuition should it be necessary to withdraw completely during the term for medical or mental health reasons.

</li>
<li><p>Loans and interest rates are based on credit approval and approval is not guaranteed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Loans are not federally guaranteed; therefore, do not have the same deferments, forbearance, cancellation and consolidation benefits</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms and conditions for private alternative educational loans vary greatly. Students are advised to compare loan programs before choosing a lender. Interest rates, fees and other provisions of these programs are subject to change by the lender.

<h2 id="return-of-federal-title-iv-funds">Return of Federal Title IV Funds</h2>
<p>All students who withdraw completely from the University and who have federal financial aid, including federal student loans, are subject to the return of Title IV funds policy. Under this policy, it is assumed that a student earns his or her aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled. Unearned Title IV funds, other than federal work-study, must be returned to the federal aid programs. Unearned aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV aid that exceeds the amount of earned Title IV aid.</p>
<p>During the first 60 percent of the enrollment period, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the period that the student remained enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student earned. Institutional costs play no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled</p>
<p>A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period.</p>
<p>All funds must be returned to federal programs before being returned to state or institutional aid programs and/or the student. This return of funds allocation will be made in the following specific order and will be applied to all students who have received federal Title IV assistance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct Graduate PLUS Loans) Subsidized Federal Direct Loans</p>
</li>
<li><p>Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other Federal, State, private or institutional assistance programs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="verification-of-information">Verification of Information</h2>
<p>The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students submit as a basis for aid awards. Each year, a percentage of students receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the information on which awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds.</p>
