<p>The Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) program at Santa Clara University is designed to equip leaders in information technology management with the tools to harness the power of information. Created by the same outstanding faculty that provides the premier MBA education for Silicon Valley, the MSIS degree focuses on the application of technology for solving real organizational and business problems. Much of the course work is project-based, connecting learning to actual challenges in the field. Students learn how to integrate emerging technologies into organizational practices and to successfully manage complex, technically centered change processes.</p>

<h3 id="admissions-contingencies">Admissions Contingencies</h3>
<p>Applicants may be admitted with one or more contingencies. All contingencies are documented on the student&apos;s Program Plan Card which is provided to the student at the time of admission. All contingencies must be fulfilled by the end of the student&apos;s first term in residence. Students who do not fulfill their contingency requirements by the end of their first term in residence will not be permitted to register for classes until the contingency is fulfilled.</p>
<h3 id="application-deadlines">Application Deadlines</h3>
<p>The completed application package should be sent as early as possible. The deadlines are:</p>
<p>Fall Quarter</p>
<ul>
<li>Round 1: April 1 (For scholarship consideration)</li>
<li>Round 2: May 1 (Final deadline</li>
<li>Winter Quarter October 15</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="admissions-decisions">Admissions Decisions</h3>
<p>Admissions decisions are made throughout the year. Applicants are admitted on the basis of academic ability as indicated by college records and GMAT/GRE scores, demonstrated technical management potential (including work experience and recommendations), and motivation to complete a demanding academic program. Once accepted, a non refundable tuition deposit is required prior to registration. The deposit is applied toward the student&apos;s first-term tuition.</p>
<h3 id="academic-standing">Academic Standing</h3>
<p>To qualify for the MSIS degree, a student must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in all work taken in the Leavey School of Business. A grade of C- is considered a minimum passing grade in each course. A grade of F is considered a failing grade, and the units will not be counted toward graduation requirements.</p>
<p>Students who receive an F in a required course are eligible for <strong>immediate dismissal</strong> based on the availability of the course and its requirement as a prerequisite for other courses.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0, he/she will be placed on academic probation. A student then has one quarter to raise the GPA to a cumulative 3.0 or they will be dismissed from the program. Students failing required classes may be dismissed immediately if it is mathematically impossible to return to good standing and remain on track to graduate with his/her class.</p>
<p>The administration will contact faculty midway through the term to acquire a status update on academic performance to ensure students are aware of academic resources and tutoring in an attempt to resolve matters before they affect GPA.</p>
<p>If a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0 at the end of his/her final quarter and all course requirements have been satisfied, no degree will be awarded until the cumulative GPA is a 3.0 or better through completion of additional graduate course work in the Leavey School of Business.</p>
<h3 id="student-responsibility">Student Responsibility</h3>
<p>Students enrolled in the MSBA program are required to follow the same policies and procedures as students in the evening MBA program.

</ul>
<p><strong><em>Experiential Learning Options:</em></strong></p>
<p>The primary objective of the MSIS Capstone sequence is to offer students the opportunity to complete the final step (beyond the core and elective requirements) in earning a Master of Science in Information Systems by participating in an experiential learning process and to apply the knowledge learned in the program to real life applications.</p>
<p>The program offers four options to students to achieve this objective:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Thesis option (6 units; MSIS 2644)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Industry Project option (a sequence of 1, 2, and 3 unit courses for a total of 6 units; MSIS 2640, 2642, &amp; 2643)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Capstone Design Project option (a sequence of 1, 2, and 3-unit courses for a total of 6 units; MSIS 2645, 2646, &amp; 2647)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional Coursework: a set of three MSIS elective courses (8 units)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each student is required to begin the capstone option selection process by interviewing with the capstone advisor. The advisor will determine the most appropriate option for each student. The four options are described below.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Thesis Option (MSIS 2644 -- 6 units)</em></strong></p>
<p>Students can individually or as a team of two propose a research project to one of the MSIS faculty. This option requires approval by the supervising faculty member and the director of the MSIS program. Full time students selecting this option should begin their project no later than the beginning of their second year of study. The objective of this option is to study an information system topic in detail and advance the state of the knowledge in that field theoretically, or to apply the state-of-the art information system technology to solve a problem. The outcome of this option is development of a final report and the successful submission of a research manuscript to a referred journal for publication. This option may span two or more quarters.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Industry Project Option (MSIS 2640, 2642 &amp; 2643 -- 6 units)</em></strong></p>
<p>In this option, students work with a sponsoring company, where they join forces with employees, managers, and executives to develop and implement practical, hands-on solutions to a company&apos;s information technology challenges. This option spans a minimum of two quarters. Students are responsible for the entire process, from project requirements to implementation. During the process, students form valuable working relationships with each other, faculty mentors, and leaders in the company with which they work.</p>
<p>This option consists of three MSIS Capstone courses: MSIS 2640 (1 unit), MSIS 2642 (2 units) &amp; MSIS 2643 (3 units) and is viewed as a single project-oriented course. The objective of this option is to solve a practical problem by applying and integrating the methods and concepts studied in the MSIS program. An industry capstone project must be a real project, with an identified sponsor or client. MSIS students will be interviewed and a team is selected by the Capstone Program Manager to complete each capstone project. Student teams will be limited in size, with typically four or five students in a group. The student team will define the problem, perform a feasibility study, analyze the problem, design a solution, and implement that solution to satisfy the sponsoring client. Participation in this option is competitive and there are only a limited number of such projects per year. The process for this option is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MSIS students interview with the Capstone Program Manager.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A team is made of four or five students. MSIS Program director assigns a MSIS faculty advisor to the project. The team registers for MSIS 2640 (1 unit).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The team in coordination with the sponsoring company defines the problem and performs a feasibility study. The team develops a formal project plan with specific milestones and begins the process of creating a final project plan for presentation and approval of the sponsored client.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The team registers for MSIS 2642 &amp; MSIS 2643 in two subsequent quarters. The student team and the advisor meet as needed to discuss the project, address questions, and assess progress toward completion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The student team should complete the project over approximately two quarters. A project is considered complete when all its milestones are achieved and the final project report has been accepted by the advisor and the client. A formal sign-off by the sponsoring company is required. The time span of the project may exceed two quarters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There will be a single grade for MSIS 2640, 2642, &amp; 2643. That grade will be assigned after the completion of the project. Students may take one elective course while taking this option.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Students with a full time job are discouraged from taking additional courses while enrolled in this option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon completion of the Industry Project Option, student participants must submit the MSIS Completion of Capstone Project form with the appropriate faculty signatures (faculty director and advisor) and assigned grade to the Graduate Business Programs Office. The grade will be submitted to the Office of the Registrar for posting for all courses.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Capstone Design Project Option (MSIS 2645, 2646, &amp; 2647 -- 6 units)</em></strong></p>
<p>Students selecting this option can satisfy their capstone requirement by working on a self-defined information systems project approved by the MSIS program director. This option, upon approval, is expected to span a minimum of two quarters and students are encouraged to start the process once they have completed most of their core courses. Students are responsible for the project completion, and students should submit all deliverables stated in their project proposal, including a working prototype and the final report summarizing their results and the learning experiences</p>
<p>This option consists of three MSIS Capstone courses: MSIS 2645 (1 unit) (for project proposal) &amp; MSIS 2646 (2 units) &amp; MSIS 2647 (3 units) (for project execution). It is intended that MSIS 2645 (1 unit) will be completed in three months, during which students are expected to write a successful project proposal, identify knowledge and skills needed for project execution, required data and resources necessary for project completion. The MSIS 2646 (2 units) &amp; MSIS 2647 (3 units) are intended to be completed over a sequence of two quarters. Given the length of the design project option, students deciding to pursue this option should contact the MSIS Capstone Project Manager one year before expected graduation date.</p>
<p>The design project option is initiated by students and supervised by a faculty. The objective of the design project is to focus on an area of personal/group interest, possibly a start-up concept, solving a self-initiated problem by applying and integrating the knowledge gained in the MSIS program. Students will developing extra-curricular skills (decision making, negotiation, making contacts, confidence building, and teamwork) and demonstrate skills and competencies to enhance employability and entrepreneurship. MSIS students will be interviewed and a team is selected by the Capstone Project Manager. The team will be limited in size, with typically three or four students in a group. The team will define the problem, perform a feasibility study, analyze the problem, design a solution, and implement the project.</p>
<p>The process for this option is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One or more students prepare a 1-2 page preliminary project proposal, which should include rationale for conducting the design project, description of the problem(s) of interest, learning objectives, data or other resources to be used, required reading, expected expertise and support, and deliverables upon project completion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This preliminary project proposal is submitted to the Capstone Project Manager. The Capstone Project Manager at this stage could ask the students to change/revise the preliminary project proposals to ensure consistent format and quality of the proposal. Upon acceptance of the proposal, he selects the remaining team members based on the preliminary project proposal, required skills and experiences. The MSIS Program Director and the Capstone Project Manager will then assign a MSIS Faculty Advisor to the project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The team registers for MSIS 2645 (1 unit)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The team, in coordination with the MSIS Faculty Advisor, will finalize the problem definition and develop a formal project proposal which should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A clear description of the problem/creative enterprise A preliminary survey/review of relevant literature</p>
</li>
<li><p>A description of the proposed methodology</p>
</li>
<li><p>Expected outcome/product (which will include a fully functional prototype) Method of evaluation</p>
</li>
<li><p>The time frame and project schedule Meeting schedule</p>
</li>
<li><p>Online platform used for team discussion and keeping research diary</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Next the team registers for MSIS 2646 &amp; MSIS 2647 in two subsequent quarters. A project is considered complete when all its milestones are achieved, a working prototype is produced, and the final project report has been accepted by the Faculty Advisor and the MSIS Program Director. Note that the time span of the project execution depends on the team progress and may exceed two quarters.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There will be a single grade for MSIS 2645, MISIS 2646 &amp; MSIS 2647. That grade will be assigned after the completion of the project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Students may take one elective course while taking MSIS 2646 &amp; MSIS 2647 in this option. Students with a full-time job are discouraged from taking additional courses while enrolled in this option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Capstone: Additional Coursework (8units)</em></strong></p>
<p>This option will require approval of the MSIS director and is only intended for exceptional circumstances in which a student cannot select one of the other three options. In such a case, the student is required to take three electives (9 units). The additional electives will require approval of the MSIS director. It is also noted that this option requires nine units of additional coursework to satisfy the capstone requirement and results in a total of 57 units (rather than 54 units) in order to complete the requirements for the MSIS degree. Students are discouraged from choosing this option. However, under special circumstances, a student granted this option acknowledges and accepts that this option requires an additional 3 units of coursework beyond that required by the other three capstone requirement alternatives, bringing the total number of units required for graduation to 54 units instead of the 51 units required by the other three capstone requirement alternatives.</p>

<p>A continuation of the internship curriculum started in MSIS 2696. Course cannot be repeated for credit. Pre-requisite: OMIS 2596 and MSBA student. The objective of this course is to provide an in-depth introduction to the topic of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. These algorithms are based on the theory of Dynamic Programming and Markov Decision Processes, which originated more than fifty years ago. But in recent years, the use of Deep Learning algorithms to RL systems, known as Deep Reinforcement Learning, has led to big gains in performance for applications such in Robotics, Quantitative Finance and Game Playing systems. In the first half of the course we start by discussing Markov Decision Processes, Dynamic Programming algorithms and the concept of Value Functions. We introduce the idea of<em> Reinforcement Learning as a way to do optimal control in cases when a system model is</em> not available and information about the Value Function is obtained by analyzing its sample paths. RL Algorithms such as Monte Carlo based learning, Temporal Difference Learning* and Q-Learning are discussed in detail. Concepts such as on-policy and off-policy learning, policy exploration vs exploitation are also explained. In the second half of the course we introduce the idea of using Deep Learning Neural Networks as function approximators for RL systems, which leads to a large increase in thecomplexity of systems that can be handled using RL. The Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm is discussed in detail. We then discuss Policy Gradient methods such as the REINFORCE algorithm, and then combine Value Function and Policy Gradient methodstogether and come up with Actor-Critic Algorithms. We also discuss Model based RL,which results in the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Applications of these concepts in the areas of Game Playing systems, Finance and Robotics are also discussed.</p>
