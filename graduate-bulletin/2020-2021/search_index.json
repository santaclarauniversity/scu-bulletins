Dean","keywords":"","body":"Welcome From the Dean\nGo anywhere, from here.\nThis place is for the bold. The tenacious. The ambitious. A place to embrace the challenge of transforming ideas into action.\nHere you'll collaborate with the most brilliant minds in entrepreneurship, ethics, innovation, and theory. And you'll do it all from the most prolific business environment on earth, Silicon Valley.\nThe Santa Clara University School of Business connects you, our students and alumni, in a strong network of successful people that spans industries and generations in and around Silicon Valley. Our network transcends us, providing invaluable connections at any stage in one's career. Being a Santa Clara Bronco creates an instantaneous bond with others who have been through our programs, creating a lasting and lifelong community always within reach.\nOur program sits at the intersection of business and education, allowing you to apply what you're learning in real-time---to both local businesses and your own work---thus reaping the benefits of our program long before you graduate from our halls.\nOur Jesuit ethics and principles of social justice are deeply instilled in our community. They are what set us apart. We not only teach standard business practices, we teach you about the triple bottom line---people, profit and planet---and how to do what's best for all three.\nThe Leavey School's robust relationship with Silicon Valley, where experimentation and risk-taking are the norms, not the exceptions, provides hands-on experience for you and access to bright, eager leaders of tomorrow for global companies headquartered in the world's most dynamic economy.\nSo, whether you're searching for a degree, a program, or certificate, whether it's to rise above your peers, shift a career, or ignite a vision, from here you can go anywhere.\nWelcome!\nNaren Agrawal\nDean Leavey School of Business\n"},"introduction-business_mission_and_priorities.html":{"url":"introduction-business_mission_and_priorities.html","title":"Mission","keywords":"","body":"School of Business Mission\nThe Mission Statement for the Leavey School of Business defines our values, our distinctive characteristics, our goals, and our motivation. The mission statement sets a standard for our activities that is consistent with our aspirations. It offers a way to differentiate the Santa Clara Business School experience, and it leaves open the opportunity for the development of new curriculum, new scholarly pursuits, and new programs that change our students and our community.\nThe Leavey School of Business is a community dedicated to innovative learning and scholarship. We find inspiration in Silicon Valley's entrepreneurial spirit, blending the intersection of business and education, to transform people, ideas, and organizations allowing students to apply what they are learning in real time. We are committed to a collaborative learning environment that develops leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion dedicated to the triple bottom line of people, profit and planet.\nStrategic Priorities\nIn support of our mission, we establish three strategic priorities:\n\nBuild a rich academic foundation and transformative learning experience for our students\n\nWe will create a comprehensive and integrated experience that improves the opportunities for our students by enhancing their learning and preparation.

Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, law, engineering, education, counseling psychology, pastoral ministries, and theology. The University boasts a diverse community of scholars offering a values-oriented curriculum characterized by small class sizes and a dedication to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education--educating the whole person for a life of service--run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs.\nThe University was established as Santa Clara College on the site of the Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally operated as a preparatory school and did not offer collegiate courses until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. One-third of the students were enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college's preparatory and high school departments.\nSanta Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added. In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business opened in 1926, and within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the country to receive national accreditation.\nFor 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admissions explosion--from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began the largest building program in school history, building eight residence halls, a student union, and an athletic stadium. In 1985, the University adopted \"Santa Clara University\" as its official name.\nFor more on Santa Clara University, including University Vision, Mission, and Fundamental Values, Academic Programs, Centers of Distinction, Faculty, Student Body, Alumni, and Campus, visit the Undergraduate Bulletin.\n"},"chapter2-graduate_business_programs.html":{"url":"chapter2-graduate_business_programs.html","title":"Chapter 2: Graduate Business Programs","keywords":"","body":"Graduate Business Programs\nStatement of Purpose\nSanta Clara University's Business School develops men and women of competence, conscience, and compassion who can provide leadership in technologically advanced and rapidly changing global environments. The development of competence is reflected in our commitment to teaching excellence and the scholarly research necessary to animate instruction and foster the creation of knowledge. The development of conscience is enhanced through an emphasis on reflective inquiry that is both professionally rigorous and ethically sound. Compassion is at the intersection of competence and conscience, and is fostered through an appreciation of multiple perspectives and recognition of the human being as part of every equation.\nMission Statement of the Graduate Business Programs Office\nThe Santa Clara University Graduate Business Programs team works to provide the LSB graduate community with an outstanding educational, co-curricular, and career-management experience.\nMBA Programs Learning Objectives\nMBA students at Santa Clara University learn to:\n\nUnderstand the changing environment--social, economic, technological, legal, political, and cultural-- within which firms operate and how the environment impacts business decisions and survival\n\nUnderstand factors that influence and improve the performance of culturally diverse teams and organizations Gather, analyze, and interpret data in order to make better decisions\n\nAddress the organizational impacts of technology, rapid change, global integration, and a culturally diverse workforce Effectively communicate analyses and conclusions in support of a desired course of action\n\nBe sensitive to the challenge of making ethical decisions and acting as a responsible corporate citizen where these imperatives may conflict with enhancing shareholder value\n\n\nMS Programs Learning Objectives\nSee program specific chapter.\nProfessional Orientation\nThe MBA Program at Santa Clara University is designed specifically to meet the needs and concerns of working professionals. To allow students to pursue their MBA degrees while continuing their careers, classes are scheduled in the evening or weekend. The curriculum blends instruction in theory with practical applications, enriched by faculty engaged in state-of-the- art research and students who deal daily with real-life organizational concerns.\nAcademic Standards\nSanta Clara's MBA Program has a reputation for quality, providing both academic rigor and practical relevance. Admission standards are selective, as the courses are demanding and the expectations from both the faculty and fellow students are high, although the atmosphere is still collegial and not competitive. While the MBA degree is considered a final professional degree, we look to admit students focused on receiving an education, not simply a piece of paper, for their time and effort. Students should be prepared for an intensive course of study encompassing all the major functional and disciplinary areas and involving both quantitative and qualitative skills.\nAccreditation\nSanta Clara University was in the original group of MBA programs in 1961 accredited by AACSB International--the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The AACSB is the specialized accrediting organization that conducts periodic in-depth reviews of business schools to ensure that their curricula, faculty, and students meet the highest standards of excellence. Re-accredited in 2016, Santa Clara's program has consistently met the high standards of the AACSB. Less than 10% of the world's 13,000 business programs have earned AACSB Accreditation. Santa Clara is also accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). Such regional accreditation is a prerequisite for the specialized program accreditation provided by AACSB International.\nStudent Body\nApproximately 750 students are enrolled in the MBA and M.S. Programs. Entering MBA students represent a variety of undergraduate and graduate fields of study. MBA students, on average, have 8 years of work experience at time of admission. The average grade point average of entering MBA students is 3.3, and the average GMAT score is 616. This blend of academic backgrounds and work experience provides opportunities for enhanced learning both in and out of the classroom.\nMany of our MBA students are working professionals--people who work full time in local companies and take three to four courses each quarter. Students come from more than 500 organizations that comprise a list of Silicon Valley's most vibrant businesses.\nAlumni\nSince 1961, more than 15,000 men and women have received their MBA or M.S. degrees from Santa Clara University. As one of the first MBA programs to be accredited by AACSB International, SCU's Leavey School of Business has been educating the next generation of leaders who shape our world for decades. Among our University alumni are more than 2,000 company presidents and senior corporate executives, many of them leaders in global technology companies. Our graduates have gone on to be leaders in Fortune 500 firms, startup and early growth companies, as well as in family and non-profit organizations. The high regard for the Santa Clara MBA degree also is reflected in the number of Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay Area companies that have a relationship with the university.\nThe Business School's External and Alumni Relations team offer various events throughout the year. These events are designed to provide opportunities to connect with fellow alumni, faculty, and staff, as well as provide lifelong learning forums. Leavey School of Business alumni are very involved in these networking events. They serve on information panels, welcome new alumni at commencement, host local reunions, share their stories with prospective students, and participate in coaching students through our professional institutes and clubs.

Students who fail to drop a course, even if they do not attend, or fail to notify the University of their intent to withdraw, regardless of the reason, will be responsible to pay all tuition and fee charges.\nNeither informing an individual faculty member, an academic department, nor the Dean's Office constitutes an official withdrawal from the University. The official date of withdrawal from the University cannot be backdated prior to the date on which the student submits the applicable withdrawal form or the Records Office receives notification.\n3 Unit and 4 Unit courses\nStudents who drop 3 or 4 unit courses or withdraw from the University will receive a tuition refund in accordance with the following:\n\nBy the end of the first week of classes -- full tuition refund for the term, less any applicable fees\n\nBy the end of the second week of classes -- a 50 percent tuition refund for the term, less any applicable fees\n\nBy the end of the third week of classes -- a 25 percent tuition refund for the term, less any applicable fees\n\nAfter the third week of classes -- no tuition refund for the term\n\n\nPlease note: Students may drop courses online until 11:59 p.m. on the Sunday immediately following the beginning of the term and still receive a 100 percent refund. However, this is only valid if a student has no registration holds and does not require assistance from a staff member. All other transactions must be completed by 12pm on the first Friday of the term.\n2 Unit courses\nStudents who drop 2 unit courses or withdraw from the University will receive a tuition refund in accordance with the following:\n\nPrior to the second class meeting - a full tuition refund, less any applicable fees\n\nNo tuition refund as of the second class meeting and thereafter\n\n\nSaturday Courses\nStudents enrolled in a weekend course in which the first class meeting is after the first week of the term must provide written notification to their respective Records Office of their intent to withdraw or drop any weekend/off cycle course(s). Failure to comply with this process will result in an irreversible forfeit of tuition.\nThe following refund schedule applies:\n\nStudents will receive a full tuition refund, less any applicable fees, if written notification is received by 5 p.m. on the Tuesday immediately following the first class meeting.\n\nStudents will receive a 50 percent tuition refund, less any applicable fees, if written notification is received by 5 p.m. on the Tuesday immediately following the second class meeting.\n\n\n1 Unit Courses\nStudents enrolled in a course must provide written notification to their respective Records Office of their intent to withdraw or drop any course(s). Failure to comply with this process will result in an irreversible forfeit of tuition.\nThe following refund schedule applies:\n\nStudents will receive a full tuition refund, less any applicable fees, if written notification is received within two business days prior to the first class meeting.\n\nStudents will receive 50 percent tuition refund, less any applicable fees, after the first class meeting and prior to the second meeting.\n\nIf the course has only one session no refund will be granted.\n\n\nExecutive MBA Program\nThe Executive MBA tuition is a flat rate amount, and charged in equal amounts over the respective quarters of the program. Registration is processed by the program office each quarter, which generates the quarterly charge.\nThe following refund and withdrawal policies apply:\n\nStudents will receive a full tuition refund of the first quarter charge, less any applicable fees, if written notification to the Office of Graduate Programs is received within one business day prior to the first day of classes.\n\nStudents will receive a full tuition refund of the first quarter charge, less a $3,000 penalty and any applicable fees, if written notification to the Office of Graduate Programs is received within one business day prior to the first day of fall classes on campus.\n\nThe EMBA program is cohort based, and continuous enrollment is required. Students who wish to withdraw in subsequent quarters must notify the Office of Graduate Programs in writing within two business days prior to the first day of classes in order to avoid the quarterly tuition charge and any applicable fees.\n\nStudents are prohibited from dropping individual classes within a quarter.\n\n\nLeave of Absence\n\nA leave of absence request must be made in writing to the Graduate Business Programs Office. Students approved must return the following year and join the next EMBA cohort at the quarter when the leave was granted. Students are limited to one leave of absence during the duration of the program, and are not charged during the leave period, as registration generates billing.\n\nFinancial Hardship\nStudents who withdraw from the University or drop courses due to an illness, injury, or psychological/emotional condition are eligible for a tuition refund in accordance with the schedule above. Tuition insurance may be purchased to cover tuition charges for medical or emotional related withdrawals that occur after the first week of the term.\nSanta Clara University degree students who withdraw from the University or who are administratively withdrawn from the University after the third week of the term due to a qualifying financial hardship may be eligible for an allocation from the student hardship fund for 25 percent of the tuition charges for that term. Qualifying financial hardships include: (1) death, disabling injury, medical emergency, (2) loss of job by an independent student, (3) medical or other emergency involving a dependent of an independent student, and (4) student deployment for active military duty. The Vice Provost for Student Life or designee, in consultation with the Financial Aid Office, will determine qualifying financial hardships and any allocation from the student hardship fund. Students must submit a request for an allocation from the student hardship fund by the end of the applicable term.\nNo tuition refunds are made because of curtailed services resulting from strikes, acts of God, civil insurrection, riots or threats thereof, or other causes beyond the control of the University.\nTuition Insurance Protection\nStudents may protect themselves against financial loss due to unexpected withdrawal from the University for medical or mental health reasons by purchasing tuition insurance provided by A.W.G. Dewar Inc. This low cost plan is designed to protect from loss of funds paid for tuition should it be necessary to withdraw completely during the term for medical or mental health reasons. Plan enrollment is available annually or by quarter. Enrollment must be completed before the first day of school to be eligible for insurance benefits. Information on the plan is available from the Bursar's Office or Dewars' website:www.collegerefund.com.\nFinancial Aid\nFinancial assistance for Graduate Business Programs students is available.

Ford Direct Graduate PLUS Loan program is designed to provide additional federal assistance to students. Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans are not based on financial need, but do require credit approval.\nLoan information:\n\nNon need-based with credit approval Must be enrolled at least half-time\n\n2020-2021: 7.08% fixed-variable rate, capped at 10.5%*\n\n2020-2021: 4.248% origination fee* Unsubsidized\n\nFAFSA required annually\n\nMust complete Entrance Counseling & a Master Promissory Note Must meet satisfactory academic progress standards\n\nRepayment begins 60 days after final disbursement\n\n\nSubject to federal change\nAdditional information may be obtained from the Enrollment Services Center located in the Schott Admissions & Enrollment Services Building, 408-551-1000.\nPrivate Alternative Loans\nPrivate alternative educational loans are available from private lenders for students whose cost of attendance has not been met with other financial aid. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is not required to apply for a private alternative educational loan. Private alternative educational loan programs differ from the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program in several ways:\n\nAnnual and total loan limits are higher\n\nInterest rates are normally variable rates that change on a quarterly basis\n\nLoans and interest rates are based on credit approval and approval is not guaranteed\n\nLoans are not federally guaranteed; therefore, do not have the same deferments, forbearance, cancellation and consolidation benefits\n\n\nThe terms and conditions for private alternative educational loans vary greatly. Students are advised to compare loan programs before choosing a lender. Interest rates, fees and other provisions of these programs are subject to change by the lender. Additional information may be obtained from the Enrollment Services Center located in the Schott Admissions & Enrollment Services Building, 408-551-1000.\nDeadlines\nThe Financial Aid Office has established deadlines for the programs it administers. All students requesting financial aid from the University should contact the Enrollment Services Center at the earliest possible date, and request specific deadline information and appropriate application materials. All financial aid deadlines are posted on the Financial Aid website. The Enrollment Services Center and the Financial Aid Office communicate with students through SCU email addresses only.\nVeterans and Veterans' Dependents Assistance\nSanta Clara University is certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died Santa Clara University is certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 percent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill), Chapter 33 (post 9/11 GI Bill). Individuals interested in attending under any of the veterans' assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar at 408-554-7831.\nReturn of Federal Title IV Funds\nAll students who withdraw completely from the University and who have federal financial aid, including federal student loans, are subject to the return of Title IV funds policy. Under this policy, it is assumed that a student earns his or her aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled. Unearned Title IV funds, other than federal work-study, must be returned to the federal aid programs. Unearned aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV aid that exceeds the amount of earned Title IV aid.\nDuring the first 60 percent of the enrollment period, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the period that the student remained enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student earned. Institutional costs play no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled\nA student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period.\nAll funds must be returned to federal programs before being returned to state or institutional aid programs and/or the student. This return of funds allocation will be made in the following specific order and will be applied to all students who have received federal Title IV assistance:\n\nUnsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct Graduate PLUS Loans) Subsidized Federal Direct Loans\n\nFederal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans\n\nOther Federal, State, private or institutional assistance programs\n\n\nVerification of Information\nThe United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students submit as a basis for aid awards. Each year, a percentage of students receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the information on which awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds.\n"},"chapter5-academic_information.html":{"url":"chapter5-academic_information.html","title":"Chapter 5: Academic Information","keywords":"","body":"Academic Information\nStudent Records\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the confidentiality of the University records of Santa Clara University students. The University is authorized under provisions of the Act to release directory information to any person on request, unless a student explicitly requests in writing that the University not do so and keep directory information confidential.\n\"Directory Information\" includes the following items:\n\nName\n\nAddress (campus, local and/or permanent; e-mail) Telephone number\n\nDate and place of birth Photographic image\n\nMajor field of study, classification, dates of attendance, expected graduation date, degrees, and honors received Most recent previous educational institution attended\n\nParticipation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics height and weight of participants on intercollegiate athletic teams\n\n\nNo other information may be released concerning a student without the written authorization of that student. If a student prefers not to have any information about herself/himself released to anyone, that student must fill out a non-disclosure form and submit it to the Office of the Registrar. Requests for non-disclosure may be filed with the Office of the Registrar during the registration period and throughout the academic year. Once filed, the request remains in effect until the fall term begins for the following academic year--regardless of when the request was filed--unless a written request to remove it is received. Requests for non-disclosure by students in their last term of enrollment remain in effect until cancelled by the student. Requests from former students are honored at the University's discretion.\nCertain records are excluded by law from inspection, specifically those created or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist in connection with the treatment or counseling of a student. Parents' financial information, including statements submitted with scholarship applications, also is excluded by law from inspection. Third parties may not have access to educational records or other information pertaining to students without the written consent of the particular student.\nFormer or current borrowers of funds from any Title IV student loan program should note carefully that requests for nondisclosure of information will have no effect on preventing Santa Clara University from releasing information pertinent to employment, enrollment status, current address, and loan account status to a school lender, subsequent holder, guarantee agency, U.S. Department of Education, or an authorized agent.\nStudents have the right to inspect and review their educational records at the following offices:\n\nThe Office of the Registrar maintains official academic records, including application forms, admission transcripts, letters of acceptance, and a student's permanent academic record.\n\nThe Deans, in their respective offices, maintain working academic files\n\nThe Office of Student Life maintains records relating to a student's nonacademic activities.\n\nRecords relating to a student's financial status with the University are maintained in the various student financial services offices.\n\n\nStudents have the right to request the amendment of their educational records to ensure that they are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of a student's privacy or other rights. Students may direct complaints regarding academic records to the Dean of the college or school in which they are enrolled or to the University registrar. In addition, students have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Santa Clara University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Written complaints should be directed to the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Ave., S.W., Washington, D.C. 20202-5920.\nDetailed information can be found on the Family Compliance Office website:\nComplete information on Santa Clara University's student records policy can be found here..\nCampus Security and Crime Statistics Act\nThe U.S. Department of Education requires universities that receive Title IV funding to disclose certain information, including institutional graduation rates, athlete graduation rates, financial assistance awarded, and crime statistics. Information presented in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act is made available to assist current and potential students and employees in making informed decisions regarding their attendance or employment with Santa Clara University. To view the Santa Clara University reports, visit the Campus Safety Services website.\nA paper copy of the annual crime statistics report may be obtained by writing to Campus Safety Services, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053.\nAcademic Regulations\nStudent Responsibility\nAll official communication from the University and Graduate Business Programs is sent to the student's Santa Clara University email address.\nThe student is personally responsible for knowing all of the academic regulations in the MBA or M.S. Program in which they are enrolled. Failure to understand these regulations and requirements does not relieve the student of responsibility. The student is responsible for resolving any holds placed on his or her record.\nHonor Code\nAs an institution of higher education rooted in the Jesuit tradition, Santa Clara University is committed to creating and sustaining an environment that facilitates students' academic, personal, and ethical development. This commitment balances freedom of individual choice and expression with the expectation that individual members of the community will:\n\nBe honest\n\nDemonstrate self-respect and respect for others\n\nDemonstrate respect for the law and University policies, procedures, and standards.\n\n\nEngaging in any form of academic dishonesty, such as plagiarism (representing the work or ideas of others as one's own without giving proper acknowledgment), cheating (e.g., using unauthorized resources or assistance on coursework, copying the work of another person, falsifying data, sabotaging the work of others, and the unauthorized use of electronics, media, or data), or other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context will subject the student to disciplinary action.\nEvery student is required to sign the honor code and adhere to its conditions.\nAcademic Integrity\nThe University is committed to academic excellence and integrity. It is the student's responsibility to do his/her own work and to cite sources of information, whether paraphrased or quoted. For assistance in identifying when something should be cited please check here. In addition, course syllabi commonly elaborate on the specifics of academic integrity appropriate for the individual class.\nFinal responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course. If the student wants to withdraw from the course but the instructor's signature is required, the instructor is within his/her rights to sign or decline to sign an approval of the withdrawal.\nAcademic Integrity Protocol\nThe Leavey School of Business is committed to academic excellence and integrity. Students are expected to do their own work and to cite any sources they use. A student who is guilty of a dishonest act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to and including dismissal from the University, as a result of the student judicial process as described in the Graduate Business Programs Bulletin. A student who violates copyright laws, including those covering the copying of software programs, or who knowingly alters official academic records from this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action.\nAllegations within the Context of a Course\nThese procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University community with a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind as described in the Student Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, or the use of prohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allegation of student academic dishonesty. The following describes procedures for resolution by due process.\nIf the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolution begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs the student of the suspicion. If the instructor judges on the basis of available evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severity of the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, \"F\" on the particular assignment, or \"F\" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair, to the Dean (who may delegate this to the appropriate administrative resource in the Leavey School of Business), and to the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the matter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom.\nAppeal Process for Academic Sanctions\nIf, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor's decision, the student will contact the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or his/her designate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department.\nThe department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if he or she believes that the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only role is to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty member from a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the\nOffice of Student Life will arrange for the participation of the student panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair.\nThe parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a particular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon a belief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evaluation and therefore will not review the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student.\nAfter reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of her or his recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student, to the Dean (who may delegate this to the appropriate administrative resource in the Leavey School of Business), and to the Office of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course.\nDecisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are intended to be confidential.\nIf the student wishes to withdraw from the course, the instructor's approval is required for the withdrawal process. The instructor may refuse to approve of the withdrawal and assign an appropriate grade.\nUniversity Judicial Process\nWhen the Office of Student Life receives the report, the Senior Assistant Dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files.\nIf it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the severity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integrity violations.\nAllegations Outside a Course\nIf the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The Senior Assistant Dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved.\nAttendance\nStudents are expected to attend class sessions. Specific attendance requirements are set by the faculty in the syllabi of individual courses and are binding. Students should select courses carefully in a quarter when an unavoidable absence is necessary. Attendance during the first week of the quarter is critical. Students are not automatically dropped from a class if they do not attend.\nCompletion Requirements\nThe requirements for the MBA or MSIS degree must be completed within six years of admission, including leaves of absence and any other break in attendance. Requests for an extension of the six-year completion requirement must be made in writing and include a detailed plan of how and when the requirements will be met. Approval of the extension request is at the discretion of the senior director, Graduate Business Programs Academic Support and Records. For, MSFA and MSBA program completion requirements, contact the M.S. Programs Director.\nAcademic Standing\nStudents must maintain an overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 in all work taken in the Leavey School of Business. A grade of C- is considered a minimum passing grade in each course. A grade of F is considered a failing grade, and the units will not be counted toward graduation requirements.\nIf a student has a cumulative GPA below 3.0 during the first 17 units of study, he/she will be placed on academic warning. After completing 17 units, students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing. Students on academic probation have the following 2 quarters of attendance to meet the minimum 3.0 cumulative GPA requirement. If the student fails to increase the cumulative GPA to 3.0, he/she may be disqualified from the program.\nA student is allowed to appeal a disqualification one time only. The process begins with the student submitting a written appeal, including the steps to be taken to reestablish good academic standing. Further registration will not be allowed until the written appeal has been approved. Upon approval, the student will be responsible for adhering to the plan outlined in the appeal. If, at any time, the conditions of the appeal are not met, or the student is not consistently making academic progress, the student will be withdrawn from all classes and required to leave the program.\nAcademic probation and disqualification status are noted on the student's transcript but academic warning status is not noted. Because of the short timeframe of the MSBA and MSF programs, the above policy has been revised for these students as follows:\nPlease review the chapters for M.S. programs in this bulletin for academic standing policies.\nThe administration will contact faculty midway through the term to acquire a status update on academic performance, and to ensure that students are aware of academic resources and tutoring in an attempt to assist the student in improving performance.\nIf a student has a cumulative GPA below a 3.0 at the end of his/her final quarter and all course requirements have been satisfied, no degree will be awarded until the cumulative GPA is a 3.0 or better through completion of additional coursework in the SCU graduate business school.\nGrading\nThe grading system is as follows:\n\n  A      B      C      F\n  A = 4.0    B+ = 3.3   C+ = 2.3   F = 0.0\n  A- = 3.7   B = 3.0    C = 2.0               B- = 2.7   C- = 1.7   \n\nThe A grade indicates distinguished performance and competence; the A- and B+ ranges indicate excellent performance and competence; and a B grade demonstrates work meeting academic and professional standards. Grades in the B- and C+ ranges are given for acceptable performance levels in a particular course but are insufficient for meeting overall performance requirements and graduation requirements. A C- grade is the minimal passing grade. A grade of F is given for performance that insufficiently demonstrates academic and professional competence. Instructors may assign grades without pluses and minuses at their discretion.\nThe University also uses the following designators for which no unit credit or grade point value is granted:\nI: Incomplete\nN: Continuing work\nNS: No Show\nW: Withdrawn\nP: Pass\nNP: No Pass\nRepeating Failed Courses\nWhen a student repeats a course after failing to pass it on the first attempt, the grade received on the second attempt shall replace the initial grade in the calculation of the student's GPA upon receipt of a petition from the student. A failed course may be repeated only once. The Academic Support and Records Office must approve requests for a third attempt. If approved and the course is successfully repeated on the third attempt, only one of the previous F grades will be replaced in the calculation of the student's GPA. All attempts are reflected on the student's transcript. A course completed with a passing grade may not be repeated. A student who fails an elective has the option of taking the same course again (if offered) and the student's GPA will be recalculated. The student may take a different elective but it will not count as a repeated course, and the grade will not replace the grade from the failed course. The program is under no obligation to offer electives to allow a student to repeat the elective course that was not successfully completed. A failing grade received as a sanction for a violation of the academic integrity protocol may not be replaced.\nDisputing Grades\nIf, after completing a course, a student receives a grade that he/she wishes to dispute, the following steps must be taken:\n\nA student shall first resolve the grade issue with the instructor.\n\nIf the issue remains unresolved, the student may submit a written appeal to the appropriate department chairperson.\n\nIf, after review by the department chairperson, there is still no resolution, the student may submit a formal appeal to the Senior Assistant Dean of Graduate Business Programs.\n\nIf a change in grade occurs, the instructor will submit the grade change to the Graduate Business Programs Office to be recorded and posted. The instructor of record is the only person who can authorize a grade change.\n\n\nIncomplete Grades\nAn \"I\" (Incomplete) grade may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the instructor within three weeks of the beginning of classes in the next scheduled term (not the student's next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, unless extraordinary circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University registrar within the original three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quarters after the incomplete was assigned, excluding summer session. An incomplete that has not been completed within the specified deadline or has not received an approved extension will be converted to a grade of \"F.\"\nNS (No Show) Grades\nThe \"NS\" (No Show) grade is assigned when a student fails to attend and does not drop a course for which he/she has registered. The NS grade does not impact the student's GPA but cannot be changed or removed from the transcript. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mark of \"NS\" in a class.\nWithdrawn (W) Grades\nA \"W\" (Withdrawn) is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements for dropping a class or withdrawing from the University after the quarter's add/drop period. A mark of \"W\" cannot be changed to any other grade. A \"W\" is included in the student's academic record and appears on the student's transcript but has no effect on the student's GPA.\nRegistration\nEach quarter, a registration period is held to allow all graduate business students to enroll in classes. Students are assigned appointment times in the eCampus system during the designated initial registration period. Appointment times are assigned based on the number of units a student has accumulated plus current enrollment (some exceptions apply). During the initial registration period, students may register for no more than 10 units (does not apply to M.S. students). Upon completion of the initial period, students may add, drop, or swap classes until the end of the first week of classes. Students may drop classes at any time during the quarter until the designated last day to drop classes. (See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter 4.)\nPrior to registering for classes, a student must resolve any registration holds that have been placed on his/her student record. To resolve a hold, the appropriate office(s) must be contacted. To navigate the eCampus registration system effectively, students are encouraged to monitor their accounts and clear any holds. Students will not be able to add or swap any classes until their records are clear. New students are encouraged to clear any holds as soon as possible related to pre-program competencies and missing transcripts identified at time of admission.\nOnce classes have begun, students may withdraw from courses without prior approval up to the seventh week of the quarter. After that date, the student must get approval from the Graduate Business Programs Office. Courses cannot be dropped once the final exam has been administered. (See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter 4.)\nWait Lists\nAfter the initial registration period, waitlists are used to enroll students during the open enrollment period. Students are allowed to add themselves to the waitlist through eCampus for courses that have reached capacity during the initial registration period. Students who are on waitlists will be enrolled into available spaces provided they do not have time or section conflicts. The student is responsible for monitoring her/his position on the waitlist. Pending no conflicts exist, students will be registered automatically and are responsible for dropping the class if enrolled via waitlist.\nAt the end of initial registration, classrooms are assigned and capacities are increased accordingly. Once capacities have been increased, the waitlists are scheduled and processed until the day before classes begin. All waitlists are then purged and students can add themselves to a class if space becomes available up until the last day to add a class.\nNote: The only way to enroll in a course is through eCampus. Instructors cannot add students to their class rosters.\nLeave of Absence\nAll students who do not register by the end of the first week of any quarter of the academic year, excluding summer quarter, will be placed on the inactive list unless they have been given leaves of absence. A leave of absence request must be made in writing to the Graduate Business Programs Office. If a leave of absence is requested after registration has occurred, the student is responsible for dropping all classes in addition to filing for the leave of absence.\nA leave of absence will be granted only for a specified period of time and normally not for more than one year. If the approved period for the leave of absence is exceeded and the student does not contact the Graduate Business Programs Office to request an extension by the end of the first week of the current quarter, the student must re-apply to the program and will be considered for readmission as a new applicant. A leave of absence will only be granted for two quarters if no coursework has yet been completed. A leave of absence is not required for students who do not attend summer quarter.\nLeaves of absence are included in the six year program completion requirement.\nProgram Withdrawal\nTo withdraw from the University, a written notification must be submitted to the Graduate Business Programs Office. The student is responsible for dropping courses through eCampus separately from withdrawal from the University.\nWithdrawal from the University is not officially complete until the student clears obligations with the Bursar's Office. Students on deferments or federal loans also must clear their financial obligations with the Bursar's Office. Refund checks for approved graduate course withdrawals are issued by the Bursar's Office. It is the student's responsibility to contact that office and request disbursement. (See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter 4.)\nReadmittance\nA student who does not register for any quarter, excluding summer quarter, and does not apply for a leave of absence, will be placed on the inactive list. When a student is placed on the inactive list, an application for admission accompanied by a reapplication fee of $75 must be submitted. The student then will be considered for readmission on the same basis as a new applicant. The student also will be required to fulfill any additional requirements and satisfy any curriculum changes the business school may adopt during the interim period between registrations. Credit is not guaranteed for previous completed course work and no further leaves of absence will be allowed.\nIf the student has attended another school, all transcripts must be sent to the Graduate Business Programs Admissions Committee, Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053. All course work taken in the interim must be satisfactorily completed, and the student must be in good standing, in order to be considered for readmission.\nConcurrent Enrollment\nA student in the MBA or M.S. Programs will not be allowed concurrent enrollment in Santa Clara University's other academic programs or at any other university. Exceptions are the J.D./MBA or J.D./MSIS Combined Degree Program and courses taken elsewhere to satisfy pre-program competencies. Once a student has enrolled, no transfer credit for course work done at another university will be granted without permission from the Senior Director, Graduate Business Programs Academic Support and Records. Due to the nature and rigor of the MBA and M.S. Programs, a student's full attention is required to maintain good standing in the program.\nJesuit Transfer Agreement\nStudents who leave the Santa Clara area to pursue other work or personal opportunities may participate in the Jesuit Transfer Agreement. Under this agreement, students who have completed 50 percent or more units at SCU may attend another AACSB-accredited MBA Program at one of the participating Jesuit schools and transfer units back to SCU to complete their degrees.\nTo begin this process, the student must schedule an appointment with the MBA Programs staff to review his/her academic\nhistory and discuss the participating school's requirements. Providing the student is in good academic standing and has completed 50 percent or more of the degree requirements at SCU, the degree will be granted by Santa Clara University.\nIf a student has less than 50 percent of the units required to award an MBA degree at SCU, they may apply to a participating Jesuit school and transfer the units already earned at SCU to that institution. Under this agreement, the student transferring out of Santa Clara University is required to meet all application and admission criteria of the receiving school. Upon admission to the receiving school, students will be informed of which units will be transferred from SCU to the institution. The receiving school will award the degree. Note: This agreement does not apply to Online MBA. For more information visit [http://jesuitmba.org/]{.underline}\nCourtesy Students\nIncoming\nStudents who have been admitted to the Leavey School of Business as visiting students from another AACSB-accredited MBA Program are considered courtesy students. During the application process, courtesy students will be asked to submit a list of pre-approved courses from their sending institution. Upon admission, this list of courses will be kept in the student's file for reference during the registration period. The Graduate Business Programs Office will register all courtesy students for the approved classes on a space-available basis after SCU degree-seeking students have registered.\nOnce registration has occurred, courtesy students will be responsible for checking their eCampus accounts for billing and tuition information. All bills will be sent to the SCU email address assigned to the courtesy student. Information regarding the billing process can be obtained by contacting the One Stop Enrollment Center.\nUpon completion of the courses approved by the sending institution, courtesy student records will be inactivated. Official transcripts are to be requested by the student directly from the Office of the Registrar.\nOutgoing\nStudents who need to complete their MBA/MS program outside of SCU, and cannot take advantage of the Jesuit Transfer Agreement, may apply for courtesy student status at another AACSB-accredited MBA Program/Business School. A maximum of six graduate units are allowed for transfer back to Santa Clara University. Courses for transfer must be pre-approved by the Graduate Business Programs Office. Credit will be given for approved coursework completed with a B or better grade and upon receipt of the official transcript.\nPrinciples for Faculty and Student Conflict of Interest\nThe Leavey School of Business is committed to the development of good business practices in an open and collaborative environment. The faculty makes a reasonable effort to prevent conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts from developing with enrolled Graduate Business students. The following guidelines apply:\n\nThe educational purposes within the classroom and University are foremost and supersede commercial interests.\n\nStudent work is regarded as the intellectual property of the author(s), and written permission must be received prior to use outside the classroom.\n\nNeither faculty nor students shall be asked to sign nondisclosure agreements for class-related work.\n\nFaculty and students should not expect that any discussion of general or specific economic or organizational matters, or information that is disclosed in the course of that discussion, can be considered confidential, either implicitly or explicitly.\n\nFaculty and students should not engage in financial or business relationships with one another while they are teaching and/or enrolled in a course together.\n\n\nPetitions and Grievances\nRequests for exceptions to Leavey School of Business policies must be made in writing and submitted to the Graduate Business Programs Office. Student grievances regarding courses and policies should be sent to the Graduate Business Programs Office.\nAcademic Advising\nMBA and M.S. advisors are available as needed for all students. Appointments are required in order for the advisor to prepare in advance. For an appointment, call 408-554-5485 or send an email to mba\\@scu.edu. All students, especially those with questions regarding choosing courses and their academic progress, are encouraged to consult with their adviser. Online MBA students may contact 408-514-5501 or omba-studentservices\\@scu.edu; MS Marketing Online students may contact 408-514-5501 or omsm-studentservices\\@scu.edu.\nCurricular Practical Training\nSanta Clara University offers international students with F-1 immigration status in the MBA/MSIS/MSFA programs the opportunity to engage in Curricular Practical Training in accordance with Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) regulations.\nTo be eligible to participate in CPT, students must have been enrolled full-time for one complete academic year, be in F-1 status at the time of application, and have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 in their graduate course work. Students wishing to participate in CPT must be enrolled in a qualifying internship/practicum course: i.e., IDIS 3797, IDIS 3798, or the MSIS Capstone course. Students must work with the staff in the International Students & Scholars office and their qualifying course instructor to complete the necessary CPT co-op agreement. The student is responsible for the tuition associated with the qualifying courses. SEVP guidance on CPT administration is subject to change at any time.\nExceptions to Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations\nThe Bulletin contains the academic and administrative policies and regulations that govern enrollment of students at Santa Clara University. Students are responsible for knowing all academic and administrative policies and regulations affecting their program of study and for abiding by all such policies and regulations during their period of enrollment at the University. Continued enrollment is subject to compliance with the academic and administrative policies and regulations as described herein and otherwise published by the University. Failure to understand the policies and regulations does not relieve a student of his or her responsibility for adhering to the policies and regulations.\nThe University Registrar is tasked with ensuring that degree requirements, academic program policies and regulations, registration policies and regulations, grading policies and regulations, and academic credit evaluation as described in the Bulletin are implemented appropriately.\nOn rare occasions, students may request an exception to policy. Requests must be associated with issues or events of an extreme nature that were unforeseen and beyond the control of the student. Poor performance in course work; missed deadlines; change of major or educational plans; or a course grade's adverse effect on the student's grade point average, probationary standing, or other eligibility are not sufficient reasons for granting an exception.\nStudents should submit their request and the appropriate documentation using the following link: [https://www.scu.edu/registrar/forms/]{.underline}. The Office of the Registrar will review the request for exception with three business days from the date of submission and notify the student of the decision.\nAppealing the Decision of the Office of the Registrar\nA student, who does not agree with the decision of the Registrar, can request an appeal by submitting a formal request for reconsideration to the Office of the Registrar. The request should describe the specific situation and explain the basis of the request for reconsideration. The student should also provide any relevant documentation. All requests for reconsideration must be submitted within ten business days of the original decision of the Office of the Registrar.\nOnce the request for an appeal is received, the Office of the Registrar will convene a three person panel consisting of an Associate Dean of the relevant College or School, the Dean of Academic Support Services (or designee), and an Associate Dean of Student Life (or designee). The panel will use the general standard that the basis of appeal must be related to issues or events of an extreme nature that were unforeseen and beyond the control of the student. The panel will review requests for exception within fifteen business days from the date of submission and notify the student of the decision within two business days.\nInformation for Resident of the State of Georgia who are Completing an Online Program\nStudents who are in an online program and are residents of the State of Georgia can appeal the University's final decision through the\nState of Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission\\\n2082 East Exchange Place, Suite 220\\\nTucker, GA 30084-5305\\\n(770) 414-3300\\\nhttps://gnpec.georgia.gov/\n"},"chapter6-mba_curriculum.html":{"url":"chapter6-mba_curriculum.html","title":"Chapter 6: MBA Curriculum","keywords":"","body":"MBA Curriculum\nNote: Refer to designated chapters for curriculum details specific to the Masters of Science in Information Systems, Finance, Business Analytics, and Executive MBA Programs.\nThe Santa Clara MBA program is designed to develop leaders with a broad business, economic, and social perspective who are capable of managing change in dynamic environments. Students develop a breadth of understanding through coursework in accounting, economics, finance, management, marketing, and operations management and information systems; and depth by concentrating electives in particular functional cross-disciplinary areas.\nThe below information describes the curriculum for students entering the Evening MBA Program Winter 2017 and later, and those continuing students who choose to change to the 2017 curriculum.\nProgram Design\nThe design of the curriculum was guided by several overarching goals:\n\nTo provide students with the skills and bodies of knowledge that support successful, fulfilling careers.\n\nTo continue to strengthen the curriculum alignment with the LSB's primary points of distinction: Engagement with Silicon Valley\n\nStrong content related to Entrepreneurship and Innovation (in both new and established firms) Blending theory and practice to help students put ideas into action\n\nCommitment to the Jesuit ideals of ethics, integrity and corporate and individual social responsibility\n\n\nOverview of Curriculum\nThe Santa Clara MBA curriculum consists of 70 units across 15 core courses (44 units), and 26 additional units of free electives. While entering students are recommended a particular schedule for their first year, there is considerable flexibility in the order in which courses are taken (with the caveat that all prerequisites must be satisfied before enrolling in a particular course). Math analysis/calculus and basic statistics proficiency is expected when entering the MBA program. Please note that the Evening MBA and Online MBA follow the same curriculum and requirements.\nSchedules\nDuring the fall, winter, and spring quarters, classes generally meet twice per week for ten weeks for 95 minutes per session. 2-unit courses generally meet twice per week for five week covering the first or second half of a quarter.

Electives may be taken any time during the program assuming the prerequisite coursework is complete. Electives can also be used to earn a concentration in a particular discipline. Any course offered in conjunction with the MBA program, with the exception of those otherwise required, is considered an elective. For descriptions of elective courses, please consult the website. New courses are continually being developed and may not be listed.\nIndependent Study\nA student may elect to register for independent study to fulfill an elective requirement. Independent study courses are numbered 3698 (e.g., AGRI 3698, MGMT 3698, etc.). A student may take only one independent study course during their program. To obtain permission to register for independent study, students should prepare a complete proposal well in advance of the quarter in which they wish to undertake the study. The proposal must be reviewed and signed by a tenured faculty member who thereby agrees to supervise and evaluate the study. The proposal is then reviewed by the department chair who must approve the proposal. The proposal is then be submitted to the Graduate Business Programs Office for final review. A signed copy of the proposal must be on file in the Graduate Business Programs Office before registration. An independent study is graded in the same manner as all other courses.\nConcentrations\nSanta Clara University's MBA program has a general management perspective but also provides an option for students to complete a concentration. When a student petitions for a concentration prior to graduation the concentration is reflected on her/his official transcript pending completion of all required courses before the degree is awarded. Although the awarded concentration will appear on the student's official degree transcript, it does not appear on the student's diploma. Concentrations require at least 12 elective units in a specific discipline, and coursework completed outside of Santa Clara University does not satisfy concentration requirements. See below for more information.\nData Science and Business Analytics Concentration / STEM Designation for F-1 Students\nFaculty Coordinators: Sanjiv Das (Finance and Business Analytics) and Xiaojing Dong (Marketing and Business Analytics)\nLearning Objectives\nDevelop critical thinking skills for strategic evaluation and implementation of current data science (and big data) paradigms, including problem definition.

Currently, only the three numbered courses, below, are offered in the MBA program, and, ideally, all students completing the concentration in Food Entrepreneurship will complete all three to ensure that they have a broad perspective of the industry. Almost all students are in the program for at least two years and most students take longer. Each of the three courses has been offered at least once every two years, so students will have the opportunity to take all three courses during their time in the MBA program. We plan to add a fourth independent study course once the concentration is approved and, later, a fifth course, tentatively entitled Food Entrepreneurship. Five courses would give students a reasonable number of choices within the food industry course offerings.

Students are exposed to multinational business issues and multicultural perspectives in many of the required courses. Most departments offer electives focusing on international issues from a disciplinary or functional perspective. MBA students have the option to participate in study abroad opportunities during the MBA program. Recent study abroad locations have included Brazil, China, France, England, Vietnam, Germany, New Zealand, Turkey, and India. Leavey School of Business faculty lead all trips. The Global Business Perspectives courses are considered\nelective courses. Students must be in good academic standing to be eligible for enrollment. A maximum of two global initiative courses may be taken toward a student's elective requirements.\nMBA Anywhere Program\nThe SCU Anywhere Program allows students to take electives on-campus or online from another Master's program. This applies to the Evening MBA, Online MBA, Online MS in Marketing and Online MS in Finance and Analytics Programs. The SCU Anywhere Program will offer greater flexibility and course availability for all Online and Evening MBA students. Students may take up to 12-units of elective credit in another program. Tuition fees will be based on the student's original program.\nEvening MBA students must complete an online student success seminar before they begin their first online course. Students will have access to the online student success seminar approximately 4 - 6 weeks before the course begins. Online courses are asynchronous and students can login at any time to complete their coursework. For all courses, Module 0 provides an overview of each course (including the syllabus) and opens the Friday before the first day of instruction. Students may access the full course beginning on the first day of class. Online courses will take place at [http://onlinelearning.scu.edu/]. If you encounter technical difficulties, call 833-822-2276 or email mba\\@scu.edu.\nOnline students must use a separate Camino tile for on-campus courses. Do not access it via [https://onlinelearning.scu.edu]. Instead, access it through your Single Sign-On.\nGraduate Transfer Credit\nGraduate transfer credit may be granted if specific requirements are met. A maximum of two courses (6 quarter units) of graduate credit from another AACSB-accredited MBA program may be transferred for either required or elective courses if the course was:\n\nOpen to graduate students only\n\nCompleted by the student with the equivalent of a B or better grade\n\nPart of an incomplete MBA degree program when taken no more than six years prior to application to the SCU MBA program AND is Considered by the Graduate Business Policy Committee to be functionally equivalent to a course or combination of courses offered by Santa Clara's MBA Program.\n\n\nGraduate transfer credit is granted on a course-by-course basis. No credit will be given for coursework done elsewhere while in the MBA program without prior approval. This restriction does not apply to students participating in the Jesuit Transfer Agreement.\nPrerequisites\nBefore registering for electives, students are responsible for ensuring that they have completed all the prerequisites. Prerequisites for each course are listed in the course descriptions in this bulletin.

This can be accomplished because certain course work taken at the School of Law can be transferred for credit toward the MBA or MSIS degree, and, conversely, certain course work taken at the Leavey School of Business can be transferred toward the J.D. degree.\nThe J.D./MBA dual degree prepares students to approach problems from the perspectives of both a business person and a lawyer. Joint degree lawyers will better understand the business problems that give rise to legal problems, such as issues in marketing, personnel policies, or financing. They can do more than simply determine whether a proposed solution is \"legal\"; joint degree lawyers can design and formulate an effective and imaginative solution that meets legal requirements and permits clients to best achieve their business objectives.\nThe J.D./MSIS degree allows students to develop a deep technological understanding of the legal issues in the Information Technology industry and to learn how to use technology effectively in a law practice.

The design places great emphasis on innovation throughout the curriculum. A key component is an international experience in the midterm of the program.\nEntrance Requirements\nTo be admitted to the Executive MBA program, the applicant must have at least eight-plus years of full-time work experience and a record of accomplishment leading people, projects, or programs. Strong applicants will be those who already hold the kind of leadership positions that many people attending conventional MBA programs hope to attain.

Admission is in the fall term only.\nPolicies and Procedures\nExecutive MBA students must adhere to the policies and procedures described in this bulletin. Please refer to Chapter 4 in this bulletin for tuition and refund policies.\nCourse Descriptions\nThe following is a detailed description of the Executive MBA curriculum. The total program requirement is 62 units, comprised of 56 core units and 6 units of electives.\nTerm One\nEMBA 900. Leadership in Dynamic Environments\nThe program begins with a three-day residential weekend taught by Dr. Barry Posner, an internationally renowned leadership expert. In this intensive weekend seminar students receive 360-degree feedback about themselves as leaders, learn about and develop skills related to the practices of exemplary leaders, and determine action plans for improving themselves as leaders back in their workplaces. The weekend also helps orient students to setting personal goals, working effectively in small groups, and expanding their learning processes. (3 units)\nEMBA 901. Strategic Management\nStrategy is inherently dynamic. This course focuses on the processes by which managers position their businesses to create and sustain an advantage relative to rivals in the face of uncertainty, rapid change, and competition. Strategy involves understanding the utility of different choices and tradeoffs -- choosing what not to do is as important as choosing what to do. As a result, the course will expose you to frameworks and concepts for analyzing a firm's environment and competitive position to inform the strategic decision making process. By uncovering the factors that make some strategic positions strong and viable, we shall develop the ability to evaluate the effects of changes in resources & capabilities, industry forces, macro-environmental forces, and technology on industry structure and firm behavior and, in turn, on a firm's opportunities for creating, capturing and sustaining superior profits relative to rivals. (4 units)\nEMBA 902. Managing Organizations & Teams\nRegardless of your particular industry, functional role, or technical expertise, as you advance in your career, your time will increasingly focus on managing, motivating, and communicating with individuals and teams in your workplace---and on designing jobs, reward systems, and entire organizations for accomplishing these tasks. Indeed, organizational leaders estimate that they can spend up to of 30% of their time focusing on interpersonal issues. This course is concerned with understanding the behavior that takes place within organizations to help you become a more influential leader and to increase the effectiveness of both you and your organization. It focuses on helping you better understand the nature and dynamics of social behavior as they relate to performance in real-world business settings, and draws heavily on research from the fields of psychology, social psychology and sociology. Using a combination of case analyses, videos, exercises, and field projects, the course relates existing theory and research in the social sciences to organizations by reviewing basic concepts about interpersonal, team, and organizational behavior. (3 units)\nEMBA 903. Analytics\nFocuses on building the foundations upon which every cutting-edge BA application is built: statistics and mathematical optimization. Students learn about computational algorithms and software that are essential to implementation. Students will also engage in the crucial steps such as asking meaningful questions, structuring a framework in which their answers are to be pursued, and extracting actionable insights from numerical findings. (6 units)\nTerm Two\nEMBA 904. Macroeconomics in the Global Economy Theory, Empirics, and Policy\nThe macroeconomic and global economic environment in which businesses operate can profoundly influence firm performance. This course helps managers understand the determinants of national output, income, and expenditure, employment and unemployment, inflation, interest rates, financial crises, international movements of capital, exchange rates, and many other macroeconomic variables. Economic models are utilized to explain how these variables are interrelated and to predict how they change over time, enabling managers to make well-informed decisions important to the success of their businesses. The course has a strong empirical component and utilizes economic data extensively to examine recent and historical economic events to illustrate how the models work. Emphasis is placed on the role of government policy (fiscal, monetary, and regulatory) in promoting economic growth, reducing the output loss and unemployment associated with recessions, controlling inflation, preventing or mitigating the consequences of financial crises, and reducing inequality. The course stresses the importance of the global economy to U.S. businesses and covers the international linkages among countries in goods and financial markets, including the determinants of exchange rates, the current and capital account balances, and international debt. (3 units)\nEMBA 905. Financial Accounting\nEvery day businesses and markets generate data that must be quickly and accurately captured and reported for use by decision makers. This course introduces the roles, concepts, legal requirements and impacts of financial reporting. We cover the basic financial statements and the analysis and recording of transactions, with a focus towards interpretations of reported results. By the end of this course, students should be able to demonstrate a specific working knowledge of the following course objectives: The impact on accounting of a changing regulatory environment, globalization and politics, including the role of the SEC and international standard setters; The accrual basis of accounting, including the double entry accounting system for recording business transactions and adjustments, as well as the key issues in the timing and recording of revenues and expenses; The application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), an introduction to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and how GAAP is used to prepare, explain and analyze the primary financial statements; The ability to perform a financial analysis and make investment and lending decisions using a set of corporate financial statements. (3 units)\nEMBA 906. Corporate Finance\nThis course covers valuation and how valuation is used to make corporate business decisions. It goes into the details of building financial models for decisions ranging from undertaking a new product to acquiring a company. It also covers the determination of funding needs, sources of funding, and general capital structure policy (6 units).\n \nTerm Three\nEMBA 907. Creativity for Innovative Business\nCreativity is one of the most important skills needed for tomorrow's workforce. It is necessary for effective problem solving, developing successful strategies, and driving innovation. Organizations must be creative and innovative to survive. This experiential course will explore creativity in the business context and the implications for individuals. We will focus on exercises and activities designed to enhance creativity of managers so that can they can use non-obvious techniques to break down business problems and craft new and innovative solutions. Students will learn about and apply creative thinking tools, explore and develop their own creative processes, and collaborate in team creative problem solving. (1 unit)\nEMBA 908. Marketing Strategy\nMarketing has a rich and multifaceted role in the modern organization. It is charged with focusing on the customer, providing value and recapturing value for the firm. Strategic marketing management involves determining which customers an organization should serve by analyzing customer needs, segmenting the market selecting a target segment and then determining the 4p's (Product, Pricing, Promotion and Place) for the chosen segment. Product managers, channel leaders, sales leaders and CMOs are some of the stakeholders involved in this process. Today's marketers have an increasing amount of data available to them and the modern practice of marketing involves effectively using this data to inform decision making. This course provides information necessary for an experience executive to develop a working knowledge of marketing. Going beyond the fundamental 4P's of marketing the course also introduces the rigorous lens of the three C's---the customer, competitors and the company. The course also emphasizes data driven marketing and the idea the customers are heterogeneous in their needs. (3 units)\nEMBA 909. Managerial Ethics\nThis course is an introduction to business ethics that focuses specifically on the kinds of ethical issues that managers typically encounter. Course topics include the psychological factors that influence moral decision-making, normative approaches for dealing with ethical issues in management, and application of these concepts to cases describing real life ethical dilemmas managers have faced in a variety of organizational and environmental settings. (2 units)\nEMBA 910. Managing Operations, Technologies & Supply Chains\nThe objective of this course is to consider the operations of a supply chain from a managerial perspective. It focuses on improving the performance of the firm and its supply chain through coordination among multiple sites, functions, and economic factors (customers and suppliers). Students learn to design and implement both cross-functionally, within the firm, and across an industry value chain among interacting firms. These strategies include optimizing supply chain facilities, coordinating information and material flows, managing supplier relations, and managing customer order fulfillment processes. (6 units)\nTerm Four\nEMBA 911. New Business Ventures\nThe objectives of this course are to provide an opportunity for a person to evaluate his or her own abilities and goals in regard to new business venturing opportunities and develop an analytical framework for evaluating new business opportunities. A person can engage in this activity by buying an existing enterprise, starting a new firm, or participating in such activities in a larger, parent company. In these cases, it is necessary to make an analysis of existing and potential markets, competition, and the marketing strategies which may be employed. An analysis of people and facilities requirements also is essential, and ultimately all of the plans for the enterprise must be converted into a detailed financial plan. Another objective of this course is to understand the challenge of developing viable revenue projections based on a coherent market logic. This market logic usually involves the need to combine several market opportunities into a \"sensible but compelling\" profit and loss projection. review some of the special operating problems of new enterprises including the problems of survival in the early years, maintaining growth in an orderly fashion, and maintaining momentum as the market in which the entity competes approaches maturity. Class time will be devoted about equally to a discussion of cases and concepts and presentations by guest lecturers who have had experience in business venture creation. Speakers will include entrepreneurs, risk capital investors, venture capitalists and selected Leavey School faculty. (4 units)\nEMBA 912. New Product Innovation\nThe development, management and marketing of new and innovative products and services (or offerings) are critically important for the success of organizations, whether they are startups or large organizations. However, this endeavor is fraught with risk and uncertainty due to which many new offerings fail in the marketplace, despite a huge expenditure in money, time and resources by firms. Hence, managers need to develop a comprehensive understanding of the design, development, management and marketing of new and existing offerings in various contexts such as high tech, B2B, B2C, services, SaaS, electronics, hardware etc. In this course, we focus on state of the art quantitative and qualitative tools and techniques which are utilized by innovative companies in managing products and services. It is especially tailored for professional managers who are interested in new product development & innovation, product management & marketing as well as product strategy consulting. It is also designed to help current and aspiring entrepreneurs make better strategic and tactical decisions for their offerings. (4 units)\nEMBA 913. Negotiating Strategies\nWe negotiate every day: with potential employers, coworkers, roommates, landlords, parents, bosses, merchants, service providers, spouses, and even our children. What price we want to pay, how much we want to be paid, who will do the dishes, all of these are negotiations. Yet, although people negotiate all the time, most know very little about the strategy and psychology of effective negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way whereas other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire? Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. It is a craft that must hold cooperation and competition in creative tension. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. Largely experiential, the course will provide you with the opportunity to develop your skills by participating in negotiations and integrating your experiences with the principles presented in the assigned readings and course discussions. (2 units)\nTerm Five\nEMBA 914.

Student teams will be limited in size, with typically four or five students in a group. The student team will define the problem, perform a feasibility study, analyze the problem, design a solution, and implement that solution to satisfy the sponsoring client. Participation in this option is competitive and there are only a limited number of such projects per year. The process for this option is as follows:\n\nMSIS students interview with the Capstone Program Manager.\n\nA team is made of four or five students. MSIS Program director assigns a MSIS faculty advisor to the project. The team registers for MSIS 2640 (1 unit).\n\nThe team in coordination with the sponsoring company defines the problem and performs a feasibility study. The team develops a formal project plan with specific milestones and begins the process of creating a final project plan for presentation and approval of the sponsored client.\n\nThe team registers for MSIS 2642 & MSIS 2643 in two subsequent quarters. The student team and the advisor meet as needed to discuss the project, address questions, and assess progress toward completion.\n\nThe student team should complete the project over approximately two quarters. A project is considered complete when all its milestones are achieved and the final project report has been accepted by the advisor and the client. A formal sign-off by the sponsoring company is required. The time span of the project may exceed two quarters.\n\nThere will be a single grade for MSIS 2640, 2642, & 2643. That grade will be assigned after the completion of the project. Students may take one elective course while taking this option.\n\nStudents with a full time job are discouraged from taking additional courses while enrolled in this option.\n\n\nUpon completion of the Industry Project Option, student participants must submit the MSIS Completion of Capstone Project form with the appropriate faculty signatures (faculty director and advisor) and assigned grade to the Graduate Business Programs Office. The grade will be submitted to the Office of the Registrar for posting for all courses.\nThe Capstone Design Project Option (MSIS 2645, 2646, & 2647 -- 6 units)\nStudents selecting this option can satisfy their capstone requirement by working on a self-defined information systems project approved by the MSIS program director. This option, upon approval, is expected to span a minimum of two quarters and students are encouraged to start the process once they have completed most of their core courses. Students are responsible for the project completion, and students should submit all deliverables stated in their project proposal, including a working prototype and the final report summarizing their results and the learning experiences\nThis option consists of three MSIS Capstone courses: MSIS 2645 (1 unit) (for project proposal) & MSIS 2646 (2 units) & MSIS 2647 (3 units) (for project execution). It is intended that MSIS 2645 (1 unit) will be completed in three months, during which students are expected to write a successful project proposal, identify knowledge and skills needed for project execution, required data and resources necessary for project completion. The MSIS 2646 (2 units) & MSIS 2647 (3 units) are intended to be completed over a sequence of two quarters. Given the length of the design project option, students deciding to pursue this option should contact the MSIS Capstone Project Manager one year before expected graduation date.\nThe design project option is initiated by students and supervised by a faculty. The objective of the design project is to focus on an area of personal/group interest, possibly a start-up concept, solving a self-initiated problem by applying and integrating the knowledge gained in the MSIS program. Students will developing extra-curricular skills (decision making, negotiation, making contacts, confidence building, and teamwork) and demonstrate skills and competencies to enhance employability and entrepreneurship. MSIS students will be interviewed and a team is selected by the Capstone Project Manager. The team will be limited in size, with typically three or four students in a group. The team will define the problem, perform a feasibility study, analyze the problem, design a solution, and implement the project.\nThe process for this option is as follows:\n\nOne or more students prepare a 1-2 page preliminary project proposal, which should include rationale for conducting the design project, description of the problem(s) of interest, learning objectives, data or other resources to be used, required reading, expected expertise and support, and deliverables upon project completion.\n\nThis preliminary project proposal is submitted to the Capstone Project Manager. The Capstone Project Manager at this stage could ask the students to change/revise the preliminary project proposals to ensure consistent format and quality of the proposal. Upon acceptance of the proposal, he selects the remaining team members based on the preliminary project proposal, required skills and experiences. The MSIS Program Director and the Capstone Project Manager will then assign a MSIS Faculty Advisor to the project.\n\nThe team registers for MSIS 2645 (1 unit)\n\nThe team, in coordination with the MSIS Faculty Advisor, will finalize the problem definition and develop a formal project proposal which should include:\n\nA clear description of the problem/creative enterprise A preliminary survey/review of relevant literature\n\nA description of the proposed methodology\n\nExpected outcome/product (which will include a fully functional prototype) Method of evaluation\n\nThe time frame and project schedule Meeting schedule\n\nOnline platform used for team discussion and keeping research diary\n\n\n\nNext the team registers for MSIS 2646 & MSIS 2647 in two subsequent quarters. A project is considered complete when all its milestones are achieved, a working prototype is produced, and the final project report has been accepted by the Faculty Advisor and the MSIS Program Director. Note that the time span of the project execution depends on the team progress and may exceed two quarters.\n\nThere will be a single grade for MSIS 2645, MISIS 2646 & MSIS 2647. That grade will be assigned after the completion of the project.\n\nStudents may take one elective course while taking MSIS 2646 & MSIS 2647 in this option. Students with a full-time job are discouraged from taking additional courses while enrolled in this option.\n\n\nCapstone: Additional Coursework (8units)\nThis option will require approval of the MSIS director and is only intended for exceptional circumstances in which a student cannot select one of the other three options. In such a case, the student is required to take three electives (9 units). The additional electives will require approval of the MSIS director. It is also noted that this option requires nine units of additional coursework to satisfy the capstone requirement and results in a total of 57 units (rather than 54 units) in order to complete the requirements for the MSIS degree. Students are discouraged from choosing this option. However, under special circumstances, a student granted this option acknowledges and accepts that this option requires an additional 3 units of coursework beyond that required by the other three capstone requirement alternatives, bringing the total number of units required for graduation to 54 units instead of the 51 units required by the other three capstone requirement alternatives.\nMSIS Graduation Petition Process\nIn order to graduate, all MSIS students must complete and submit an online Petition to Graduate. The information provided in the petition is used to order and mail the diploma and list names in the SCU Commencement Book. If this data changes after the petition has been submitted, students must re-submit an amended petition. Students failing to do so could be omitted from the commencement book and ceremony.\nIn order to be eligible to graduate, MSIS students must complete:\n\nAll required coursework specific to the year in which they began the program\n\nThe required number of units specified to the year in which they began the program The total program with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher\n\nNot have any I or N grades listed on their transcripts\n\n\nDeadlines to submit a Petition to Graduate are as follows:\n\nJune graduation February 1\n\nSeptember graduation May 1*\n\nDecember graduation August 1\n\nMarch graduation November 1\n\n\nStudents wishing to participate in the June Commencement Ceremony must complete all degree requirements by the end of the Spring quarter.\nTo Petition to Graduate, please visit the website.\nMSIS Curriculum CORE:\nMSIS 2601: Object-Oriented Analysis & Programming (4 units)\nProvide students with an overview of object-oriented programming methodology using the Java Programming Language.

These algorithms are based on the theory of Dynamic Programming and Markov Decision Processes, which originated more than fifty years ago. But in recent years, the use of Deep Learning algorithms to RL systems, known as Deep Reinforcement Learning, has led to big gains in performance for applications such in Robotics, Quantitative Finance and Game Playing systems. In the first half of the course we start by discussing Markov Decision Processes, Dynamic Programming algorithms and the concept of Value Functions. We introduce the idea of Reinforcement Learning as a way to do optimal control in cases when a system model is not available and information about the Value Function is obtained by analyzing its sample paths. RL Algorithms such as Monte Carlo based learning, Temporal Difference Learning* and Q-Learning are discussed in detail. Concepts such as on-policy and off-policy learning, policy exploration vs exploitation are also explained. In the second half of the course we introduce the idea of using Deep Learning Neural Networks as function approximators for RL systems, which leads to a large increase in thecomplexity of systems that can be handled using RL. The Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm is discussed in detail. We then discuss Policy Gradient methods such as the REINFORCE algorithm, and then combine Value Function and Policy Gradient methodstogether and come up with Actor-Critic Algorithms. We also discuss Model based RL,which results in the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Applications of these concepts in the areas of Game Playing systems, Finance and Robotics are also discussed.\n"},"chapter13-course_descriptions.html":{"url":"chapter13-course_descriptions.html","title":"Chapter 13: Course Descriptions","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 13: Course Descriptions\n"},"chapter13-accounting.html":{"url":"chapter13-accounting.html","title":"Accounting (ACTG)","keywords":"","body":"Accounting\nProfessors: Yongtae Kim, Susan Parker\nAssociate Professors: Michael J.

Crowdsourcing and Expert-sourcing: Strategies for Innovation\nFirms are rapidly adopting internet-based collaboration technologies (CT) to involve a wide range of participants in joint product innovation or co- innovation. Broadly defined, these technologies include software tools and applications that leverage social activity within an online platform to facilitate interaction and collaboration among members of an online community and between members of a community and a firm. As such, they help firms engage the creativity and problem solving skills of firm-hosted online communities of users, employees, and other experts in the creation, development and refinement of products or services. As a result, their use may yield innovations that strongly fit user preferences while also, accelerating the pace and lowering the cost of product innovation.

Managing Transitions I and IDIS 3800 Managing Transitions II\nThese courses prepare students for the career transitions that they will encounter once completing Santa Clara University's MBA program. These highly relevant courses concentrate on the skills students require to succeed early on in their careers. These lessons learned will be applicable to transitions throughout the students' careers. The courses are based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as an individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others' accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals' identities. Prerequisite:IDIS 3799 is required for enrollment in IDIS 3800. (1 unit)\nIDIS 3704.

Especially in high technology markets, where new purchases are capital investments measured by impact to the business and return on investment, a products value proposition has to be extremely clear, tangible and differentiated in order to achieve vendor preference, as well as maintain desired pricing and margin levels. This two credit-hour course focuses on proven, effective strategies for understanding customer requirements and translating them into clear, digestible and differentiated messaging statements.

The course defines and examines the concept of branding through a theoretical and conceptual framework and in number of business contexts. Beginning with a fundamental review of the core branding elements, we weigh the importance of both the promise and the experience aspects of branding in building and sustaining trust. An examination of brand measurements illuminates the power of metrics and highlights different aspects of branding strategies. A look at past cases of successful and unsuccessful branding brings out variations in approaches to such issues as master brands, sub-brands, and the branding of services. Finally, the impact of branding architectures and creative positioning on brand equity are considered. The course will use both management readings and current articles to provide a solid foundation for analysis. A series of cases drawn from both the product and service arenas will enable students to apply this analytical framework to actual situations. Brand equity and its related metrics provide a standard basis in evaluating various strategies for establishing and growing brands.

The objective of this course is to provide an in-depth introduction to the topic of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. These algorithms are based on the theory of Dynamic Programming and Markov Decision Processes, which originated more than fifty years ago. But in recent years, the use of Deep Learning algorithms to RL systems, known as Deep Reinforcement Learning, has led to big gains in performance for applications such in Robotics, Quantitative Finance and Game Playing systems. In the first half of the course we start by discussing Markov Decision Processes, DynamicProgramming algorithms and the concept of Value Functions. We introduce the idea of Reinforcement Learning as a way to do optimal control in cases when a system model is not available and information about the Value Function is obtained by analyzing its sample paths. RL Algorithms such as Monte Carlo based learning, Temporal Difference Learningand Q-Learning are discussed in detail. Concepts such as on-policy and off-policy learning, policy exploration vs exploitation are also explained. In the second half of the course we introduce the idea of using Deep Learning NeuralNetworks as function approximators for RL systems, which leads to a large increase in the complexity of systems that can be handled using RL. The Deep Q Network (DQN)algorithm is discussed in detail. We then discuss Policy Gradient methods such as the REINFORCE algorithm, and then combine Value Function and Policy Gradient methods together and come up with Actor-Critic Algorithms. We also discuss Model based RL, which results in the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Applications of these  concepts in the areas of Game Playing systems, Finance and Robotics are also discussed.\n"},"chapter15-career_management.html":{"url":"chapter15-career_management.html","title":"Chapter 15: Career Management","keywords":"","body":"Career Management\nYou can go anywhere from here.

Affirmative\nconsent means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Since\nindividuals may experience the same interaction in different ways, it is the responsibility of each party to\ndetermine that the other has consented before engaging in the activity.\nFor consent to be valid, there must be a clear expression in words or actions that the other individual\nconsented to that specific sexual conduct. Reasonable reciprocation can be implied. For example, if\nsomeone kisses you, you can kiss them back (if you want to) without the need to explicitly obtain their\nconsent to being kissed back.\nConsent can also be withdrawn once given, as long as the withdrawal is reasonably and clearly\ncommunicated. If consent is withdrawn, that sexual activity should cease. Consent to some sexual contact\n(such as kissing or fondling) cannot be presumed to be consent for other sexual activity (such as\nintercourse). A current or previous intimate relationship is not sufficient to constitute consent.\nConsent is based on the totality of the circumstances evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable\nperson in the same or similar circumstances, including the context in which the alleged incident occurred\nand any similar previous patterns that may be evidenced. The question of whether the responding party\nshould have known of the reporting party's incapacity is an objective inquiry as to what a reasonable\nperson, exercising sober judgment, would have known, in the same or similar circumstances.\nConsent is not voluntary if forced or coerced. Force is the use of physical violence or physical imposition\nto gain sexual access. Force also includes threats, intimidation (implied threats), and coercion that is\nintended to overcome resistance or produce consent Coercion is unreasonable pressure for sexual activity.\nSexual activity that is forced is, by definition, non-consensual, but non-consensual sexual activity is not\nnecessarily forced. Silence or the absence of resistance alone is not consent. Consent is not demonstrated\nby the absence of resistance. While resistance is not required or necessary, it is a clear demonstration of\nnon-consent.\nA person cannot consent if they are unable to understand what is happening, asleep, or unconscious for\nany reason. A person violates this policy if they engage in sexual activity with someone they know to be,\nor should know to be, physically or mentally incapacitated. This policy also covers a person whose\nincapacity results from a temporary or permanent physical or mental health condition, involuntary\nphysical restraint, or the consumption of incapacitating drug or alcohol. Incapacitation occurs when\nsomeone cannot make rational, reasonable decisions because they lack the capacity to give\nknowing/informed consent (e.g. to understand the \"who, what, when, where, why, or how\" of their sexual\ninteraction).\nIncapacitation is determined through consideration of all relevant indicators of an individual's state and is\nnot synonymous with (under the) influence, impairment, intoxication, inebriation, blackout, or being\ndrunk. It is not an excuse that the responding party was intoxicated and, therefore, did not realize the\nincapacity of the reporting party.\nReporting Options\nThere are confidential and non-confidential reporting options available. Confidential Resources include\non and off campus mental counselors, health service providers, local rape crisis counselors, domestic\nviolence resources, and members of the clergy and chaplains. Confidential on-campus resources include\nCAPS, Cowell Center, 408-554-4501; Wellness Center, 862 Market Street, 408-554-4409; and members\nof the clergy or chaplains. Confidential means that what a reporting party shares will not be\ncommunicated with anyone else unless except in extreme cases of immediacy of threat or abuse of a\nminor.\nReporting to Law Enforcement\nFor immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime of sexual violence, including sexual assault,\ndomestic/intimate partner violence, and stalking students, contact the Santa Clara Police Department, dial\n911, or contact Campus Safety Services at 408-554-4444.\nReporting to the University\nTo report an incident to the University, students may:\nReport directly to the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX\nReport online at https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/reporting/\nReport anonymously using EthicsPoint at www.scu.edu/hr/quick-links/ethicspoint/\nOther campus reporting options: Students may report incidents and seek support from other University\nofficials, including:\nThe Office of Student Life,\nThe Office of Residence Life (including Community Facilitators, Resident Directors, Assistant\nResident Directors, Neighborhood Representatives, and Assistant Area Coordinators),\nSpirituality Facilitators,\nThe Office of Housing,\nAthletics and Recreation,\nThe Center for Student Leadership,\nThe Drahmann Center,\nDisabilities Resources,\nThe Career Center, and\nCampus Ministry.\nTheses University resources are required to report incidents to the Director of Equal Opportunity and\nTitle IX, who will oversee investigation and resolution process. At the time a report is made, a\ncomplainant does not have to decide whether or not to request or participate in an investigation or\nUniversity resolution process.\nNondiscrimination Policy\nSanta Clara University prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, religious creed, sex, gender, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, marital status, registered domestic partner status, veteran status, age, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition including genetic characteristics, genetic information, or any other consideration made unlawful by federal, state, or local laws in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarships and loan programs, athletics, or employment-related policies, programs, and activities; or other University-administered policies, programs, and activities.\nAdditionally, it is the University's policy that there shall be no discrimination or retaliation against employees or students who raise issues of discrimination or potential discrimination or who participate in the investigation of such issues. The University will provide reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability under the law.\nInquiries regarding equal opportunity policies, the filing of grievances, or requests for a copy of the University's grievance procedures covering discrimination and harassment complaints should be directed to:\nBelinda Guthrie EEO and Title IX Coordinator Office of EEO and Title IX Santa Clara University 900 Lafayette Street, Suite 100 Santa Clara, CA 95050\n408-554-4113 bguthrie@scu.edu\nDrug Free Policies\nIt is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University's activities. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace even if it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct.\nThe unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and campus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clara premises where the activities of the University are conducted.\nViolations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.\nThe program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and students. New staff employees are given a copy in New Employee Orientation. New faculty employees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation. The program is reviewed at least biennially by the Office of Student Life, Affirmative Action Office, and the Department of Human Resources. Contact the Office of Student Life for a complete copy of the program.\nGender Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy Purpose Statement\nSanta Clara University is committed to providing an environment free of gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual violence and assault, relationship (dating and domestic) violence, and stalking. The University provides resources and reporting options to students, faculty, and staff to address concerns related to gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct prohibited by Title IX and University policy, and, through training and education, works to prevent its occurrence. The University seeks to provide a consistent, caring, and timely response when sexual and gender-based misconduct occurs within the University community. When the University becomes aware of allegations of sexual misconduct, it will take prompt and effective action. This action may include an initial assessment of safety and well-being, implementing interim remedies at no cost to the complainant for protection and support, discussing how the complainant wishes to proceed, initiating an investigation, and identifying appropriate avenues for resolution. The University's response will be overseen by the EEO and Title IX Coordinator.\nThe University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy applies to all students, faculty, and staff, and includes any individual regularly or temporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or serving in an official capacity at Santa Clara University (including volunteers and contractors). The policy applies to both on-campus and off-campus conduct and to online actions that have a potential or actual adverse impact on any member of the University community, or which substantially interfere with a person's ability to participate in University activities, or which could affect a substantial University interest or its educational mission.\nPolicy Statement on what Constitutes Consent\nThe University adheres to California's definition of affirmative consent for sexual activity. \"Affirmative consent\" means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Under this definition, \"No\" always means \"No.\" \"Yes\" means \"Yes\" only if it is a clear, knowing, and voluntary consent to any sexual activity. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent. Fully informed consent means that a person understands the details of a sexual interaction (who, what, when, where, why, and how).\nIt is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in that activity. Consent can be given by words or action, but non-verbal consent is not as clear as talking about what a person does or does not want sexually. Consent to some form of sexual activity cannot be automatically taken as consent to any other form of sexual activity. Silence--without actions demonstrating permission--cannot be assumed to show consent. Consent is also not voluntary if forced or coerced.\nCoercing a person into sexual activity violates the University's policy in the same way as physically forcing someone into sexual activity. Because alcohol or drug use can impair the capacity to consent, sexual activity while under the influence of alcohol or drugs raises questions about consent. It shall not be a valid excuse that the accused (hereafter \"respondent\") believed that the reporting party (hereafter \"complainant\"), affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the accused knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity.\nReporting Options\nThere are several ways to report an incident of gender-based discrimination, sexual misconduct, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking.\nFor immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime, students should call the City of Santa Clara Police Department: dial 911 or call Campus Safety Services: dial 408-554-4444.For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime, students should call the City of Santa Clara Police Department: dial 911 or call Campus Safety Services: dial 408-554-4444.\nStudents wishing to seek confidential assistance may do so by speaking with professionals who have the privilege of maintaining confidentiality except in extreme cases of immediacy of threat or abuse of a minor. Confidential resources include on- and off-campus mental counselors, health service providers, advisors available through the University's Violence Prevention Program, local rape crisis counselors, domestic violence resources, and members of the clergy and chaplains.\nStudents may report incidents and seek support from University officials, including the EEO and Title IX Coordinator, Office of Student Life, Residence Life (including Community Facilitators, Resident Directors, Assistant Resident Directors, Neighborhood Representatives, and Assistant Area Coordinators), Spirituality Facilitators, Housing, Athletics and Recreation, Center for Student Leadership, Drahmann Center, Disability Resources, Career Center, and Campus Ministry. Theses University resources are required to report incidents to the EEO and Title IX coordinator, who will oversee investigation and resolution process. At the time a report is made, a complainant does not have to decide whether or not to request disciplinary action.\nFor more information about reporting, response, and adjudication, please see the University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy or contact the EEO and Title IX Coordinator, Belinda Guthrie, 408-554-4113, bguthrie@scu.edu.\nComputing and Electronic Resources Policy\nThe computing and other electronic resources at SCU are provided solely for the support of students and employees in the pursuit of their scholarly or required academic activities, and for conducting the business of the University. General guidelines for use of computing, communication, and electronic resources on campus are based upon principles of etiquette, fairness, and legality. In using these resources at SCU, community members are expected to be respectful of other individuals' ability to enjoy equal access to the resources, refrain from malicious or annoying behavior, and abide by state and national laws, including those related to intellectual property and copyright. More details are available in the University's Acceptable Use Policy, accessible at it.scu.edu/policies/NetPolicy.shtml, or from Information Technology.\nSmoke Free and Tobacco Free Policy\nSanta Clara University has adopted a smoke-free and tobacco-free policy on the University campuses in Santa Clara and Berkeley. All University faculty, staff, students, and visitors are covered by this policy. In addition, all persons using University facilities are subject to this policy.\nThe term \"smoking\" means inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying of any lighted or heated tobacco product, as well as smoking substances other than tobacco, or operating electronic smoking devices and other smoking instruments. \"Tobacco product\" means all forms of tobacco, including\nbut not limited to cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, electronic smoking devices, and all forms of smokeless tobacco. \"Tobacco-related\" means the use of a tobacco brand or corporate name, trademark, logo, symbol, motto, or advertising message that is identifiable with the ones used for any tobacco product brand or company which manufactures tobacco products.\nGeneral Rules:\n\nSmoking is prohibited.\n\nThe use of tobacco products is prohibited.\n\nSale and advertising of tobacco products and tobacco-related products are prohibited.\n\n\nPolicy for Withdrawal for Health Reasons\nStudents may experience an illness, injury, or psychological condition, herein referred to as a health condition, which significantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely in their roles as students. In these instances, time away from the University for treatment and recovery can restore functioning to a level that will enable them to return to the University.\nThe Vice Provost for Student Life or designee, in consultation with the appropriate mental and medical health professionals and other staff as deemed necessary, is responsible for the implementation of the policy.\nContact the Office of Student Life for a copy of the entire Policy for Withdrawal for Health Reasons.\n"},"appendices-business_school_administration.html":{"url":"appendices-business_school_administration.html","title":"Business School Administration","keywords":"","body":"Business School Administration\nNaren Agrawal, Ph.D..
