<h2 id="speaker-policy">Speaker Policy</h2>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to ensure the right of free expression and exchange of ideas, to minimize conflict between the exercise of that right and the rights of others in the effective use of University facilities, and to minimize possible interference with the University&apos;s responsibilities as an educational institution.</p>
<p>The time, place, and manner of exercising speech on campus are subject to regulations adopted by the University administration. Orderly conduct, noninterference with University functions or activities, and identification of sponsoring groups or individuals are required. Outdoor sound amplification will be permitted only with explicit approval of the Vice Provost for Student Life or designee. (Refer to amplification of Sound)</p>
<p>Members of the faculty, academic departments, staff, administrative offices, or student organizations registered by authorized student government bodies may invite non-University speakers to address meetings on campus. Student groups that have not been registered by authorized student government bodies may not invite non-University speakers to address meetings on campus. If there would likely be extensive public notice or controversy associated with the presence of any speaker on campus, prior notice should be given to the head of the Office of Marketing and Communications in the case of likely inquiries from external constituencies of the University or media; and to the Director of Campus Safety Services in the case of possible protest or disruption. Except for unusual circumstances, the notice should be at least one week before the meeting or event is to occur.</p>
<p>The presence of a guest speaker on the campus of Santa Clara University does not necessarily imply approval or endorsement by the University of the views expressed by the guest speaker or by anyone else present at the event.</p>
<p>The person or organization sponsoring a speaker around whom there would likely be extensive public notice or controversy is responsible for including the above statement in its advertisement, announcements, and news releases. If deemed appropriate, the University administration may also require the above statement be read at the beginning of the event.</p>
<p>Whenever the University administration considers it appropriate in furtherance of educational objectives, it may require either or both of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That the meeting be chaired by a person approved by the University administration</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any invitation to a non-University speaker extended by a registered student organization, member of the faculty, staff, academic department, or administrative department may be rescinded only if the President, or his authorized designee, determines, after appropriate inquiry, that the proposed speech will constitute a clear and present danger to the orderly operation or peaceful conduct of campus activities by the speaker&apos;s advocacy of such actions as:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Willful damage or destruction, or seizure of University buildings or other property Disruption or impairment of, or interference with, classes or other University activities</p>
</li>
<li><p>Physical harm, coercion, intimidation, or other invasion of the rights of University students, faculty, staff, or guests Violation of law</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other disorder of a violent or seriously disruptive nature</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="liability-and-property-insurance">Liability and Property Insurance</h2>
<p>Except by expressed arrangement with the University, the University&apos;s insurance does not cover students&apos; liability or students&apos; personal property. Students may wish to seek the services of their personal insurance agent to arrange for such coverage.</p>
<h2 id="student-parking">Student Parking</h2>
<p>Parking on campus requires a valid parking permit at all times. Parking permits are available for purchase at Campus Safety Services (located in the parking structure) between 8 a.m. and midnight, seven days a week. Call 408-554-4441 for further information.</p>
<p>Copies of the current rules are contained in the Parking Plan, which can be found at Campus Safety&apos;s website: <a href="https://university-operations.scu.edu/campus-safety/parking-and-transportation-services/" target="_blank">[https://university-operations.scu.edu/campus-safety/parking-and-transportation-services/]</a></p>
<h2 id="title-ix-and-americans-with-disabilities-act">Title IX and Americans with Disabilities Act</h2>
<p>Santa Clara University prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, ancestry or national</p>
<p>origin, religion or religious creed, age (over 40), sex, gender expression, gender identity, sexual</p>
<p>orientation, marital status, registered domestic partner status, veteran or military status, physical or mental</p>
<p>disability (including perceived disability), medical condition (including cancer related or genetic</p>
<p>characteristic), pregnancy (includes childbirth, breastfeeding, and related medical conditions), or any</p>
<p>other protected category as defined and to the extent protected by law in the administration of its</p>
<p>educational policies, admissions policies, scholarships and loan programs, athletics, or employment-</p>
<p>related policies, programs, and activities; or other University administered policies, programs, and</p>
<p>activities. Additionally, it is the University&apos;s policy that there shall be no discrimination or retaliation</p>
<p>against employees or students who raise issues of discrimination or potential discrimination or who</p>
<p>participate in the investigation of such issues.</p>
<p>The Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX coordinates and oversees the prompt response, impartial</p>
<p>and thorough investigation, and equitable and timely resolution to all instances of discrimination and</p>
<p>harassment, sexual harassment, and other forms sexual misconduct involving students, faculty, and staff.</p>
<p>The Director also tracks incidents and trends involving sexual misconduct, and serves as the principal</p>
<p>contact for government and external inquiries regarding civil rights compliance and Title IX. Inquiries</p>
<p>about this policy or to report an incident of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, or sexual misconduct</p>

<p>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972</p>
<p>Title IX is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on the sex or gender of students</p>
<p>and employees in educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX states that:</p>

<p>Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy</p>
<p>Santa Clara University is committed to providing an environment free of gender-based discrimination,</p>
<p>including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual violence and assault, relationship (dating and</p>
<p>domestic) violence, and stalking. The University provides resources and reporting options to students,</p>
<p>faculty, and staff to address concerns related to gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct</p>
<p>prohibited by Title IX and University policy, and, through training and education, works to prevent its</p>
<p>occurrence. The University seeks to provide a consistent, caring, and timely response when sexual and</p>
<p>gender-based misconduct occurs within the University community. When the University becomes aware</p>
<p>of allegations of sexual misconduct, it will take prompt and effective action. This action may include an</p>
<p>initial assessment of safety and well-being, implementing interim remedies at no cost to the complainant</p>
<p>for protection and support, discussing how the complainant wishes to proceed, initiating an investigation,</p>
<p>and identifying appropriate avenues for resolution. The University&apos;s response will be overseen by the</p>
<p>Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX.</p>
<p>The University&apos;s Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy applies to all students,</p>
<p>faculty, and staff, and includes any individual regularly or temporarily employed, studying, living,</p>
<p>visiting, or serving in an official capacity at Santa Clara University (including volunteers and contractors).</p>
<p>The policy applies to both on-campus and off-campus conduct and to online actions that have a potential</p>
<p>or actual adverse impact on any member of the University community, or which substantially interferes</p>
<p>with a person&apos;s ability to participate in University activities, or which could affect a substantial University</p>
<p>interest or its educational mission. For more information about reporting, response, and adjudication,</p>
<p>please see the University&apos;s Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy or contact the</p>
<p>Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, www.scu.edu/title-ix.</p>
<p>What Constitutes Consent</p>
<p>The University adheres to California&apos;s definition of affirmative consent for sexual activity. Affirmative</p>
<p>consent means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Since</p>
<p>individuals may experience the same interaction in different ways, it is the responsibility of each party to</p>
<p>determine that the other has consented before engaging in the activity.</p>
<p>For consent to be valid, there must be a clear expression in words or actions that the other individual</p>
<p>consented to that specific sexual conduct. Reasonable reciprocation can be implied. For example, if</p>
<p>someone kisses you, you can kiss them back (if you want to) without the need to explicitly obtain their</p>
<p>consent to being kissed back.</p>
<p>Consent can also be withdrawn once given, as long as the withdrawal is reasonably and clearly</p>
<p>communicated. If consent is withdrawn, that sexual activity should cease. Consent to some sexual contact</p>
<p>(such as kissing or fondling) cannot be presumed to be consent for other sexual activity (such as</p>
<p>intercourse). A current or previous intimate relationship is not sufficient to constitute consent.</p>
<p>Consent is based on the totality of the circumstances evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable</p>
<p>person in the same or similar circumstances, including the context in which the alleged incident occurred</p>
<p>and any similar previous patterns that may be evidenced. The question of whether the responding party</p>
<p>should have known of the reporting party&apos;s incapacity is an objective inquiry as to what a reasonable</p>
<p>person, exercising sober judgment, would have known, in the same or similar circumstances.</p>
<p>Consent is not voluntary if forced or coerced. Force is the use of physical violence or physical imposition</p>
<p>to gain sexual access. Force also includes threats, intimidation (implied threats), and coercion that is</p>
<p>intended to overcome resistance or produce consent Coercion is unreasonable pressure for sexual activity.</p>
<p>Sexual activity that is forced is, by definition, non-consensual, but non-consensual sexual activity is not</p>
<p>necessarily forced. Silence or the absence of resistance alone is not consent. Consent is not demonstrated</p>
<p>by the absence of resistance. While resistance is not required or necessary, it is a clear demonstration of</p>
<p>non-consent.</p>
<p>A person cannot consent if they are unable to understand what is happening, asleep, or unconscious for</p>
<p>any reason. A person violates this policy if they engage in sexual activity with someone they know to be,</p>
<p>or should know to be, physically or mentally incapacitated. This policy also covers a person whose</p>
<p>incapacity results from a temporary or permanent physical or mental health condition, involuntary</p>
<p>physical restraint, or the consumption of incapacitating drug or alcohol. Incapacitation occurs when</p>
<p>someone cannot make rational, reasonable decisions because they lack the capacity to give</p>
<p>knowing/informed consent (e.g. to understand the &quot;who, what, when, where, why, or how&quot; of their sexual</p>
<p>interaction).</p>
<p>Incapacitation is determined through consideration of all relevant indicators of an individual&apos;s state and is</p>
<p>not synonymous with (under the) influence, impairment, intoxication, inebriation, blackout, or being</p>
<p>drunk. It is not an excuse that the responding party was intoxicated and, therefore, did not realize the</p>
<p>incapacity of the reporting party.</p>
<p>Reporting Options</p>
<p>There are confidential and non-confidential reporting options available. Confidential Resources include</p>
<p>on and off campus mental counselors, health service providers, local rape crisis counselors, domestic</p>
<p>violence resources, and members of the clergy and chaplains. Confidential on-campus resources include</p>
<p>CAPS, Cowell Center, 408-554-4501; Wellness Center, 862 Market Street, 408-554-4409; and members</p>
<p>of the clergy or chaplains. Confidential means that what a reporting party shares will not be</p>
<p>communicated with anyone else unless except in extreme cases of immediacy of threat or abuse of a</p>
<p>minor.</p>
<p>Reporting to Law Enforcement</p>
<p>For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime of sexual violence, including sexual assault,</p>
<p>domestic/intimate partner violence, and stalking students, contact the Santa Clara Police Department, dial</p>

<h2 id="policy-statement-on-what-constitutes-consent">Policy Statement on what Constitutes Consent</h2>
<p>The University adheres to California&apos;s definition of affirmative consent for sexual activity. &quot;Affirmative consent&quot; means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Under this definition, &quot;No&quot; always means &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; means &quot;Yes&quot; only if it is a clear, knowing, and voluntary consent to any sexual activity. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent. Fully informed consent means that a person understands the details of a sexual interaction (who, what, when, where, why, and how).</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in that activity. Consent can be given by words or action, but non-verbal consent is not as clear as talking about what a person does or does not want sexually. Consent to some form of sexual activity cannot be automatically taken as consent to any other form of sexual activity. Silence--without actions demonstrating permission--cannot be assumed to show consent. Consent is also not voluntary if forced or coerced.</p>
<p>Coercing a person into sexual activity violates the University&apos;s policy in the same way as physically forcing someone into sexual activity. Because alcohol or drug use can impair the capacity to consent, sexual activity while under the influence of alcohol or drugs raises questions about consent. It shall not be a valid excuse that the accused (hereafter &quot;respondent&quot;) believed that the reporting party (hereafter &quot;complainant&quot;), affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the accused knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-options">Reporting Options</h2>
<p>There are several ways to report an incident of gender-based discrimination, sexual misconduct, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking.</p>
<p>For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime, students should call the City of Santa Clara Police Department: dial 911 or call Campus Safety Services: dial 408-554-4444.For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime, students should call the City of Santa Clara Police Department: dial 911 or call Campus Safety Services: dial 408-554-4444.</p>
