The development of competence is reflected in our commitment to teaching excellence and the scholarly research necessary to animate instruction and foster </span><span>knowledge creation</span><span>. The development of conscience is enhanced through an emphasis on reflective inquiry that is both professionally rigorous and ethically sound. Compassion is at the intersection of competence </span><span>and conscience</span><span>, fostered through an appreciation of multiple perspectives and recognition of the human being as part of every equation.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Mission Statement of the Graduate Business Programs Office</span></h2><p><span>The Santa Clara </span><span>University Graduate</span><span> Business Programs team</span><span> strives to provide a transformative student-centered experience by being supportive, compassionate, and inclusive at all points in a student’s educational journey. We aspire to create student success with opportunities to network with faculty, fellow students, and alums. With collaboration across career, program, and admissions teams, GBP will enable students to be socially conscious, ethically minded, and those who understand how to lead themselves and others. </span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">MBA Programs Learning Objectives</span></h2><p><span>After completing the </span><span>MBA</span><span> program at</span><span> Santa Clara University</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>students will be able</span><span> to:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_72c21jq6ckfe-0 start"><li><span>Describe ethical dilemmas in business, and identify and articulate an ethically justifiable response using appropriate ethical frameworks. Evaluate these questions in the contexts of corporate social responsibility, stakeholders, and sustainability in modern business.</span></li><li><span>Assess global economic trends, international financial links, and key drivers of international trade and competition, and describe and analyze international differences in business environments.</span></li><li><span>Recognize and evaluate innovative business models. Understand and describe the paths for a successful start-up to evolve into a technology leader.</span></li><li><span>Write clear, well-documented, and effective memoranda and reports. Prepare and deliver professional-quality presentations.</span></li><li><span>Work effectively in a team.</span></li><li><span>Select and apply appropriate analytical techniques, models, and frameworks to business decisions. Summarize and analyze quantitative information using statistics and data visualization.</span></li><li><span>Integrate multiple business disciplines while evaluating business opportunities and challenges.</span></li></ul><h2><span class=" gdbold">MS Programs Learning Objectives</span></h2><p><span>See the program-specific chapter.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Professional Orientation</span></h2><p><span>The </span><span>Graduate Business</span><span> Programs at Santa Clara University </span><span>are</span><span> </span><span>explicitly designed</span><span> to meet the needs and concerns of working professionals. </span><span>Classes are scheduled in the evening or on weekends to</span><span> allow students to pursue their </span><span>graduate business</span><span> degrees while continuing their careers</span><span>. </span><span>The curriculum blends instruction in theory with practical applications, enriched by faculty experts (who engage in </span><span>state-of-the-art</span><span> research </span><span>or have deep industry experience) and </span><span>students whose curiosity is informed by real-life organizational concerns.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Academic Standards</span></h2><p><span>Santa Clara’s </span><span>Graduate Business</span><span> Programs </span><span>are renowned</span><span> for quality, providing academic rigor and practical relevance. Admission standards are selective, as courses are demanding</span><span>,</span><span> and faculty and fellow students </span><span>have</span><span> high expectations, although the atmosphere is still collegial and not competitive. While the MBA and MS degrees </span><span>are</span><span> considered final professional degrees, we look to admit students focused on receiving an education, not simply a piece of paper, for their time and effort. Students should be prepared for an intensive course of study encompassing all the major functional and disciplinary areas and involving quantitative and qualitative skills. Similarly, students pursuing an MS degree should expect rigorous and relevant coursework </span><span>with a more narrow</span><span> domain. </span><span>Regardless of the</span><span> program, students demonstrating curiosity, engagement, and a collaborative spirit reap</span><span> </span><span>the greatest benefits.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Accreditation</span></h2><p><span>Santa Clara University was in the original group of MBA programs in 1961</span><span>,</span><span> accredited by AACSB International–the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The AACSB is the specialized accrediting organization that conducts periodic in-depth reviews of business schools to ensure that their curricula, faculty, and students meet the highest standards of excellence. Re-accredited in 20</span><span>21</span><span>, Santa Clara’s program has consistently met the high standards of the AACSB. Less than 1</span><span>0</span><span>% of the world’s 13,000 business programs have earned AACSB Accreditation. Santa Clara is also accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). Such regional accreditation is a prerequisite for the specialized program accreditation provided by AACSB International.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Student Body</span></h2><p><span>Over</span><span> </span><span>700 </span><span>students are enrolled in the MBA and M.S. Programs. Entering MBA students represent a variety of undergraduate and graduate fields of study. MBA students, on average, have </span><span>7</span><span> years of work experience at </span><span>the </span><span>time of admission. The average grade point average of entering MBA students is 3.3, and the average GMAT score is 6</span><span>20</span><span>. This blend of academic backgrounds and work experience provides opportunities for enhanced learning in and out of the classroom.</span></p><p><span>Many of our MBA students are working professionals – people who work </span><span>full-time</span><span> in local companies and take three to four courses each quarter. Students come from more than 500 organizations that comprise a list of Silicon Valley’s most vibrant businesses.</span><span> Additionally, many of our M.S. students are international students who add to the diversity of our community. Our Online Programs have students from over 10 different states enrolled. </span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Alumni</span></h2><p><span>Since 1961, more than</span><span> </span><span>15,000</span><span> </span><span>students</span><span> have received their MBA or M.S. degrees from Santa Clara University. As one of the first MBA programs accredited by AACSB International, SCU’s Leavey School of Business has been educating the next generation of leaders who </span><span>have shaped</span><span> our world for decades. Among our </span><span>u</span><span>niversity </span><span>alums</span><span> are more than 2,000 company presidents and senior corporate executives, </span><span>and </span><span>many are leaders in global technology companies. </span><span>In addition, our</span><span> graduates have </span><span>become</span><span> leaders in Fortune 500 firms, </span><span>startups,</span><span> early growth companies, </span><span>and</span><span> family and non-profit organizations. The high regard for the Santa Clara MBA and M.S. degrees </span><span>is also</span><span> reflected in the number of Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay Area companies </span><span>with</span><span> a relationship with the university.</span></p><p><span>The </span><span>Graduate Business Programs</span><span> team offers various net</span><span>working</span><span> events for and with </span><span>alums throughout the year</span><span>. These events are designed to provide opportunities to connect with fellow </span><span>alums</span><span>, faculty, and staff</span><span> and</span><span> provide </span><span>lifelong</span><span> learning forums.
