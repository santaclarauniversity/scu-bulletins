Students should be aware that dropping a Practicum or Capstone course after the designated deadline will result in a penalty.  All students are required to attend two workshops organized by the Graduate Business Program Career Service Team. The first workshop will focus on team dynamics, effective collaboration, and communication strategies. The second workshop will cover essential project presentation skills, including structuring presentations, engaging audiences, and delivering clear, impactful messages. These workshops are designed to enhance students' teamwork and communication abilities, which are critical for success in their careers.</span></p><h2 id="h.xatoajikpo0a"><span class=" gdbold">Registering Process </span></h2><p><span>Students will be notified in the first week of the Fall Quarter and only have two weeks from the notice to submit their interest in participating and enrolling in the following Cycles:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_m9elwdjbfvw4-0 start"><li><span>Winter-Spring Practicum (Applicable to MSBA, Online MSBA, MSIS, MSFA, Online MSFA) – recommended</span></li><li><span>Winter-Spring Capstone (Applicable to MSBA, Online MSBA, MSIS) – recommended </span></li><li><span>Summer-Fall Practicum</span><span> (Applicable to MSBA, Online MSBA, MSIS, MSFA, Online MSFA) – not guaranteed</span></li><li><span>Summer-Fall Capstone (Applicable to MSBA, Online MSBA, MSIS) – not guaranteed</span></li><li><span>Spring Capstone (Applicable to MSFA, Online MSFA)</span></li><li><span>Fall Capstone (Applicable to MSFA, Online MSFA)</span></li></ul><p><span>Cycles are subjected to change based on availability.

Working closely with company employees, managers, and executives, students are guided by a faculty advisor throughout the process. They take full responsibility for the project, from defining requirements to implementation. Along the way, students build valuable relationships with their project team members, faculty mentors, and leaders in the sponsoring company. This option spans a minimum of two quarters and is designed as a single, project-oriented course. Students are encouraged to choose this option over the capstone.</span></p><p><span>The student team will define the problem, conduct a feasibility study, analyze the issue, design a solution, and implement it to meet the needs of the sponsoring company. Participation is competitive, with a limited number of projects available each year. The process is as follows:</span></p><p><span></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_rj9l1v6zdpqb-0 start"><li><span>Teams, made up of four or five students, are assigned to a project by the Practicum Program Manager. </span></li><li><span>The program team registers students on their behalf for Practicum projects. </span></li><li><span>The student team and faculty advisor meet as needed to discuss progress, address questions, and ensure the project stays on track.</span></li><li><span>This option  spans two quarters, during which students are expected to dedicate five to six hours per week.</span></li><li><span>The project is considered finished when all milestones are achieved and both the faculty advisor and the sponsoring company have signed off on the final report.</span></li><li><span>Students review Practicum project abstracts and respond to the selection poll indicating their top preferences plus a response to the skills inventory</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_tzcvmk2lmebq-0 start"><li><span>The Practicum Program Manager will select the student teams based on the selection poll plus a review of student resumes. We do our best to provide students with their top project preference, but cannot guarantee team placements</span></li><li><span>A team is made up of four or five students. The Program Director assigns a faculty advisor to the project. The team is registered for the corresponding course (2 units for the first portion of the cycle, 4 units for the second portion of the cycle).</span></li><li><span>In coordination with the sponsoring company, the team defines the problem and performs a feasibility study. The team develops a formal project plan with specific milestones and begins the process of creating a final project plan for presentation and approval of the sponsored client.</span></li><li><span>The program team registers students for completing the course in the next subsequent quarter. The student team and the advisor meet as needed to discuss the project, address questions, and assess progress toward completion.</span></li><li><span>The student team should complete the project over two quarters. A project is considered complete when all its milestones are achieved, and the advisor and the sponsoring company have accepted the final project report. A formal sign-off by the sponsoring company is required. A grade is assigned for each quarter of the Practicum. </span></li></ul><h3 id="h.y4c5eu1dq0ck"><span class=" gdbold">Capstone</span></h3><p><span>Capstone projects, while similar in structure to the practicum, differ in their focus. These projects may involve internal University initiatives, faculty-led collaborations with industry partners, or work with non-profit organizations. Through this option, students fulfill their experiential learning requirement by contributing to business analytics or information technology projects that match their interests. Designed with flexibility in mind, capstone projects typically offer remote work options and schedule team meetings around student availability—making them especially suitable for those with existing employment or who cannot attend weekly on-campus sessions.
