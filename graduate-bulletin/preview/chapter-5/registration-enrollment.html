          <hr> <body class="doc-content"><a id="id.xyqxof6wj5kq"></a><h1><span class=" gdbold">Registration</span></h1><p><span></span></p><p><span>Each quarter, a registration period is held to allow all graduate business students to enroll in classes. Students are assigned appointment times in the Workday Student system during the designated Initial Registration period. Appointment times are assigned based on the number of units a student has accumulated, ranked from higher to lower GPA (some exceptions apply). During the Initial Registration period, students may register for no more than 10 units. Upon completion of the Initial Registration period, students may add, drop, or swap classes until the end of the first week of classes. Students may drop classes at any time during the quarter until the designated last day to drop classes. See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter 3, and the Graduate Business Academic Calendar for relevant dates/deadlines.</span></p><p><span>Prior to registering for classes, a student must resolve any registration holds that have been placed on their student record. To resolve a hold, the appropriate office(s) must be contacted. To navigate the Workday Student registration system effectively, students are encouraged to monitor their accounts and clear any holds in advance of the registration period. Students will not be able to add or swap any classes until their records are clear. New students are encouraged to clear any holds as soon as possible related to pre-program competencies and missing transcripts identified at time of admission.</span></p><p><span>Once classes have begun, students may withdraw from courses, without prior approval, up to the date(s) listed in the academic calendar for that term. Courses cannot be dropped once the final exam has been administered. See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter 3 and the Graduate Business Academic Calendar for relevant dates/deadlines.</span></p><a id="kix.5vfwjhm2xzfi"></a><h2 id="h.e3or57930g8r"><span class=" gdbold">Prerequisites</span></h2><p><span>Before registering for electives, students are responsible for ensuring that they have completed all the prerequisites. Prerequisites for each course are listed in the course descriptions in this bulletin. Course prerequisites are reviewed annually by the academic departments. See Course Descriptions in Chapter 7 for prerequisites.</span></p><p><span>Although not explicitly stated in the description of individual courses, when a course is named as a prerequisite, then its prerequisites also are included by reference, and all prerequisites must be satisfied before a student can enroll.</span></p><p><span>Workday Student, the SCU student record and registration system, does not allow enrollment in any class or onto any waitlist if the prerequisites for that course have not been completed successfully. The system recognizes current enrollment in prerequisite classes at the time of registration. Course instructors cannot waive prerequisites. </span></p><p><span>Note: Graduation will not be approved until all prerequisites, required courses, and other requirements of the program have been fulfilled.</span></p><h2 id="h.hw40k1ezzibn"><span class=" gdbold">Wait Lists</span></h2><p><span>After the Initial Registration period, waitlists are used to enroll students in available seats. Students are allowed to add themselves to the waitlist through Workday Student for courses that have reached capacity during the Initial Registration period. Students who are on waitlists will be enrolled into available spaces, in the order in which they joined the waitlist, provided they do not have course time or section conflicts.  The student is responsible for monitoring their position on the waitlist. Pending no conflicts exist, students will be registered automatically and are responsible for dropping the class if they are enrolled via waitlist and no longer wish to take the course.</span></p><p><span>At the end of Initial Registration, classrooms are assigned and capacities are increased accordingly. Once capacities have been increased, the waitlists are scheduled and processed until the day before classes begin. All waitlists are then purged and students can add themselves to a class, if space becomes available, up until the last day to add a class.</span></p><p><span>Evening MS students are allowed to take one out-of-program course during their program. However, students are required to fill out an out-of-program form provided by the Graduate Business Programs Office. Placement is determined by the programs team, taking into account prerequisites, departmental approval and course availability. </span></p><p><span>Note: The only way to enroll in a course is through Workday Student. Instructors cannot add students to their class rosters.</span></p><h2 id="h.27xn3eaacwjm"><span class=" gdbold">Leave of Absence</span></h2><p><span>Students who do not register by the end of the first week of any quarter will be withdrawn from their program unless approved for a Leave of Absence. A leave of absence (LOA) is a temporary interruption in a student’s program of study.<br> <br>To request a Leave of Absence, students must use Workday, state the reason(s) for the request, and receive approval from the Graduate Business Programs Office.  A Leave of Absence cannot be granted for academic reasons (e.g., to keep a student from failing). Students are not permitted to take a Leave of Absence if they are not in Good Academic Standing or if they have an outstanding balance on their Workday account. If the request is made after registration, students are responsible for dropping all classes in addition to filing for the leave. <br><br>SCU is in compliance with federal regulations, </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2013-title34-vol3/xml/CFR-2013-title34-vol3-sec668-22.xml">34 CFR 668.22 (d)</a></span><span>, that an LOA cannot exceed 180 days in any 12-month period and may have a serious impact on a student’s financial aid. The number of days in a LOA is counted beginning with the first day of the student's initial LOA in a 12-month period. A 12-month period begins on the first day of the student's initial LOA. Any student considering requesting a LOA that receives financial aid, should consult with the Financial Aid Office to determine how their financial aid will be affected.<br><br>If a student does not return after this period, they will be automatically withdrawn from the University. LOA extensions are no longer available. A student who is withdrawn from the University due to an inability to extend their LOA beyond the 180-day policy is eligible to re-enroll without needing to reapply if they meet all of the following conditions:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_whwpddjd7ag2-0 start"><li><span>The student left in good academic standing</span></li><li><span>The student has no outstanding financial obligations with the University</span></li><li><span>The student plans to return to the same program</span></li><li><span>The student is returning within 1 year of the date of withdrawal</span></li></ul><p><span>Re-enrolling students are subject to the degree and curriculum requirements in the Graduate Business Programs Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entry. Any Leaves of Absence and Re-enrollment will count towards the six-year completion requirement for MBA and MSIS programs, and the three-year completion requirement for MSBA, MSFA, and MSM programs.</span></p><p><span>Students who do not meet the conditions above must reapply to the program as a new applicant.</span></p><p><span>Students wishing to re-enroll are held accountable to notify the Graduate Business Programs Office of their return and must complete </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScc2K5zfaS0SHzmIsLuMmwaGTCuyUVU6UkHhhyUJykcnMwgoQ/viewform">this form</a></span><span>. The Graduate Business Programs Office will notify the student regarding their re-enrollment. If a student is graduating in the same term they are returning, they must submit a Petition to Graduate Form.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Deadlines for submissions are outlined on the form.</span></p><h2 id="h.ieveb3k8ikvl"><span class=" gdbold">Program Withdrawal</span></h2><p><span>To withdraw from the University, a written notification must be submitted to the Graduate Business Programs Office. The student is responsible for dropping any courses they are enrolled in, through Workday Student, if they request to withdraw from the University. </span></p><p><span>Withdrawal from the University is not officially complete until the student clears obligations with the Bursar’s Office. Students on deferments or federal loans also must clear their financial obligations with the Bursar’s Office. Refund checks for approved graduate course withdrawals are issued by the Bursar’s Office. It is the student’s responsibility to contact that office and request disbursement. (See Tuition Refund Policy in Chapter 3.)</span></p><h2 id="h.92vab2g9eulg"><span class=" gdbold">Readmittance</span></h2><p><span>A student who does not register for any quarter and does not apply for a leave of absence, will be discontinued from their program. When a student is discontinued, an application for admission accompanied by a reapplication fee of $158 may be required to return to classes. If required, the student then will be considered for readmission on the same basis as a new applicant. The student also will be required to fulfill any additional requirements and satisfy any curriculum changes the business school may adopt during the interim period between registrations.

Requests must be associated with issues or events of an extreme nature that were unforeseen and beyond the control of the student. Poor performance in course work; missed deadlines; change of major or educational plans; or a course grade's adverse effect on the student's grade point average, probationary standing, or other eligibility are not sufficient reasons for granting an exception. </span></p><p><span>Students should submit their request and the appropriate documentation to the Graduate Business Programs Office at their respective delegated emails (</span><span class=" gduline"><a href="mailto:emba@scu.edu">emba@scu.edu</a></span><span>, </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="mailto:mba@scu.edu">mba@scu.edu</a></span><span>, </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="mailto:msprograms@scu.edu">msprograms@scu.edu</a></span><span>, </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="mailto:onlinegradbusiness@scu.edu">onlinegradbusiness@scu.edu</a></span><span>).
