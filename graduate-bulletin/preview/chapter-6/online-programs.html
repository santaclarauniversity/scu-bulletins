          <hr> <body class="doc-content"><h1 id="h.gjdgxs"><span class=" gdbold">Online Programs</span></h1><p><span>The Leavey School of Business offers several fully online programs, including the Online MBA, Online MS Marketing, Online MS Finance and Analytics, and Online MS Business Analytics. These online programs uphold the same rigorous admission requirements, tuition, learning objectives, degree requirements, faculty standards, policies, and procedures as our traditional on-campus programs. The online platform allows us to reach a broader range of students and strengthens our ability to deliver high-quality digital education.</span></p><p><span>Courses within these online programs are delivered asynchronously. This flexible format empowers students to study at their own pace and manage their schedules effectively through the</span><span><a href="http://onlinelearning.scu.edu"> </a></span><span class=" gduline"><a href="http://onlinelearning.scu.edu">onlinelearning.scu.edu</a></span><span> platform.</span></p><h2 id="h.30j0zll"><span class=" gdbold">Admissions</span></h2><p><span>The admission requirements for online programs closely resemble those outlined for on-campus programs (</span><span>see</span><span> Chapter 2), with the exception that online program applicants must be </span><span>residents within</span><span> the United States where SCU is authorized to operate (refer to </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.scu.edu/student-right-to-know-act/online-education-information-for-students/">authorized states</a></span><span>).</span></p><p><span>Prospective students can submit their applications at </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="http://slate.scu.edu/apply/">http://slate.scu.edu/apply/</a></span><span>. Currently, online programs are unable to admit students on an F1 visa. </span></p><p><span>New cohorts for the Online MBA commence in the Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer terms. The Online MS programs accept new cohorts only in the Fall and Spring terms. </span></p><h2 id="h.1fob9te"><span class=" gdbold">Student Success Seminar</span></h2><p><span>Prior to starting the program, students are encouraged to enroll in the Student Success Seminar. This is an ungraded, open course designed to familiarize them with the online learning platform. Completion of the Student Success Seminar is required.  The seminar establishes success expectations and assists students in formulating their success strategies. Access to this course is provided through </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="http://onlinelearning.scu.edu">onlinelearning.scu.edu.</a></span></p><h2 id="h.3znysh7"><span class=" gdbold">Residency Requirement</span></h2><p><span>Each online program offered by the Leavey School features an initial in-person residency. This immersive experience is designed to provide program orientation, valuable networking opportunities, in-person coursework, and a variety of workshops, sessions, activities, and/or competitions, with the specific structure varying by program. Because all online program residencies take place during the same weekend, faculty and students from different programs and disciplines have a unique chance to interact and build connections. This residency is instrumental in helping online students forge personal relationships and fostering a strong sense of community. Feedback from past online students consistently highlights the connections made during the residency as crucial for feeling connected to their cohort and experiencing the true spirit of "being a Bronco."The Online MBA program requires a 4-day on-campus residency, which includes the MGMT 3000 course. Similarly, the Online MS Marketing program features a 4-day residency, incorporating the MKTG 2300 course. The Online MS Finance &amp; Analytics program requires a 3-day residency, including the FNCE 2400 and ISBA 2401 Bootcamp. Lastly, the Online MS Business Analytics program also mandates a 3-day residency, covering the ISBA 2400 and ISBA 2401 Bootcamps.</span><span class=" gdbold"> </span></p><p><span>Residencies</span><span> are mandatory,in-person and cannot be omitted. The residency is typically held the weekend before the term begins; however, due to potential holiday conflicts, it may take place during the first week of school. It also includes pre- and post-course work.</span></p><p><span class=" gditalic">**Please note that the dates below are tentative and may be subject to change.

As students embark on their SVP journey, they'll have the opportunity to monitor their advancement through the Silicon Valley Professional dashboard. This comprehensive portfolio empowers students to align their elective courses and co-curricular experiences with their career goals. These experiences encourage ongoing reflection on their professional development throughout the program.</span></p><p><span>The dashboard serves as a networking hub, facilitating interactions with instructors, peers, and mentors. It also offers a platform for students to seek and receive feedback on their continuous progress.</span></p><h2 id="h.4tacd0gjgo3j"><span class=" gdbold">Online MS Marketing: MarTech Focus</span></h2><p><span>Throughout the Online MS Marketing program, students will explore cutting-edge marketing technologies, strategies, and tools. These include customer relationship management (CRM) systems, marketing automation platforms, data analytics tools, and emerging technologies. Students use these tools to gather, analyze, and interpret data, informing marketing decisions and crafting comprehensive strategies. The tools provided allow students to develop a thorough understanding of how technology influences and improves contemporary marketing strategies.</span></p><p><span>With a MarTech focus, students will gain hands-on experience with digital marketing tactics such as search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing, content marketing, and email marketing, while also learning how to integrate these tactics with broader marketing initiatives.</span></p><h2 id="h.26in1rg"><span class=" gdbold">Online MS Finance &amp; Analytics: Finance Forward</span></h2><p><span>In the Online MSFA program, students will acquire more than just cutting-edge finance and analytics skills. Our guiding principle, "Finance Forward," guarantees that students not only master the latest tools but also develop the judgment to select the appropriate tool for each challenge and the confidence to use it effectively. </span></p><p><span>In every course, students will face complex business challenges, addressing them with fresh analytical methods. After each course, students will record their insights, which will be assembled into an ePortfolio to be presented at the conclusion of the program.

Competitions are held during both the Fall and Spring terms, typically around weeks 7-8, depending on any conflicts with holidays. The competition spans two weeks, beginning with the distribution of the dataset and concluding with the group presentations.</span></p><p><span>Students work with real-world data from Silicon Valley companies to devise and present solutions to business challenges. This experience allows them to refine their technical knowledge and programming skills, including R and Python, while enhancing their critical thinking and collaborative problem-solving abilities. The competition emphasizes the use of both basic and sophisticated tools, techniques, and methods to solve business challenges, with a focus on determining the most appropriate approach for each situation.</span></p><p><span>At the end of the competition, groups present their solutions to a panel of judges, which may include faculty, board members, company executives, and alumni. The presentation should address all questions listed in the challenge and be approximately 20-30 minutes long. Students are required to submit their solutions through Camino, and the presentation can include tools like PowerPoint, Jupyter Notebook, and Tableau.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Additionally, students must attend an in-person event where the winners will be announced, and they will have the opportunity to meet with sponsors and company representatives.</span><span> Throughout the program, students are exposed to new content and skills that will help them succeed in the Analytics Showdown, which is sponsored by ServiceNow this quarter. Each group, consisting of 3-4 students, will work on their solution and submit it by the due date.</span></p><p><span class=" gditalic">**Please note that competition dates are tentative and may be subject to change.
