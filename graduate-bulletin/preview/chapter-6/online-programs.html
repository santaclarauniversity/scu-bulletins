          <hr> <body class="doc-content"><h1 id="h.gjdgxs"><span class=" gdbold">Online Programs</span></h1><p><span>The Leavey School of Business offers several online programs. These programs include Online MBA, Online MS in Marketing, Online MS in Finance and Analytics, and Online MS in Business Analytics. Online programs maintain identical admission requirements, tuition, learning objectives, degree requirements, faculty, policies, and procedures as their traditional on-campus counterparts. The online platform accommodates a wider range of students and enhances our capacity to deliver advanced digital education. </span></p><p><span>Courses in these online programs are asynchronous. This education format allows students to study at their own pace and provides flexibility to their own schedule through </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="http://onlinelearning.scu.edu">onlinelearning.scu.edu</a></span><span>. </span></p><h2 id="h.30j0zll"><span class=" gdbold">Admissions</span></h2><p><span>The admission requirements for online programs closely resemble those outlined for on-campus programs (</span><span>see</span><span> Chapter 2), with the exception that online program applicants must be residents within the United States where SCU is authorized to operate (refer to </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.scu.edu/student-right-to-know-act/online-education-information-for-students/">authorized states</a></span><span>).</span></p><p><span>Prospective students can submit their applications at </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="http://slate.scu.edu/apply/">http://slate.scu.edu/apply/</a></span><span>. Currently, online programs are unable to admit students on an F1 visa. </span></p><p><span>New cohorts for the Online MBA commence in the Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer terms. The Online MS programs accept new cohorts only in the Fall and Spring terms. For the Online MS Finance &amp; Analytics and Online MS Business Analytics programs, proficiency in college-level calculus and statistics is required as prerequisites. </span></p><h2 id="h.1fob9te"><span class=" gdbold">Student Success Seminar</span></h2><p><span>Prior to starting the program, students are encouraged to enroll in the Student Success Seminar. This is an ungraded, open course designed to familiarize them with the online learning platform. It is strongly advised that students complete this seminar before embarking on their courses. The seminar establishes success expectations and assists students in formulating their success strategies. Access to this course is provided through onlinelearning.scu.edu.</span></p><h2 id="h.3znysh7"><span class=" gdbold">Residency Requirement</span></h2><p><span>Each online program offered by the Leavey School incorporates an in-person residency at the program's outset, aimed at providing orientation, networking opportunities, career workshops, community service activities, in-person coursework, and immersion experiences in Silicon Valley and at Santa Clara University. The specific manifestation of these elements varies according to the requirements of each program. Given that all online program residencies occur over the same weekend, faculty and students have the opportunity to interact across programs and disciplines. Ultimately, the residency facilitates personal connections for online students, fostering a sense of community. Feedback from previous online students at LSB consistently highlights the relationships formed during the residency as a pivotal factor in feeling connected to their cohorts and grasping the essence of "being a bronco."</span></p><p><span>The Online MBA program mandates a </span><span>4-day on-campus residency</span><span>, featuring a MGMT 3000 course component. Similarly, the Online MS Marketing program entails a 3-day residency, incorporating MGMT 3200 courses. The Online MS Finance &amp; Analytics program requires a 3-day residency, including an FNCE 2400 and MSIS 2402 Bootcamp. Lastly, the Online MS Business Analytics program necessitates a 3-day residency, encompassing an MSIS 2402 and IDIS 3802 Bootcamp. Residency is hosted the weekend before the term starts and consists of pre and post-course work.</span></p><h3 id="h.vj9ityy65zf4"><span class=" gdbold">Opening Residency Dates </span></h3><ul class="lst-kix_cj9iaeulax3g-0 start"><li><span>Fall 2024:  September 19– 22, 2024 (Online MBA only)</span></li><li><span>Fall 2024:  September 20 – 22, 2024 (Online MS Programs)</span></li><li><span>Winter 2025:  January 9 – 12, 2025 (Online MBA only)</span></li><li><span>Spring 2025:  March 27 – 30, 2025 (Online MBA only)</span></li><li><span>Spring 2025:  March 28 – 30, 2025 (Online MS Programs)</span></li><li><span>Summer 2025:  June 12 – 15, 2025 (Online MBA only)</span></li></ul><h3 id="h.e3bloyv99533"><span class=" gdbold">Closing Residency Dates (Online MBA only)</span></h3><ul class="lst-kix_tuuv7cv8c8wt-0 start"><li><span>Fall 2024:  October 25 – 26, 2024</span></li><li><span>Spring 2025:  May 2 – 3, 2025</span></li></ul><h2 id="h.eh7u4utzp2we"><span class=" gdbold">Program Differentiator </span></h2><h3 id="h.33yi1z4u929j"><span class=" gdbold">Online MBA: Silicon Valley Dashboard</span></h3><p><span>Crafted to transform everyday professionals into Silicon Valley Professionals (SVPs), the Online MBA program offers a curriculum centered on innovation and ethical leadership. As students embark on their SVP journey, they'll have the opportunity to monitor their advancement through the Silicon Valley Professional dashboard. This comprehensive portfolio empowers students to align their elective courses and co-curricular experiences with their career goals., These experiences encourage ongoing reflection on their professional development throughout the program.</span></p><p><span>The dashboard serves as a networking hub, facilitating interactions with instructors, peers, and mentors. It also offers a platform for students to seek and receive feedback on their continuous progress.</span></p><h3 id="h.4tacd0gjgo3j"><span class=" gdbold">Online MS Marketing: MarTech Focus</span></h3><p><span>Throughout the Online MS Marketing program, students will explore cutting-edge marketing technologies, strategies, and tools. These include customer relationship management (CRM) systems, marketing automation platforms, data analytics tools, and emerging technologies. Students use these tools to gather, analyze, and interpret data, informing marketing decisions and crafting comprehensive strategies. The tools provided allow students to develop a thorough understanding of how technology influences and improves contemporary marketing strategies.</span></p><p><span>With a MarTech focus, students will gain hands-on experience with digital marketing tactics such as search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing, content marketing, and email marketing, while also learning how to integrate these tactics with broader marketing initiatives.</span></p><h3 id="h.26in1rg"><span class=" gdbold">Online MS Finance &amp; Analytics: Finance Forward</span></h3><p><span>In the Online MSFA program, students will acquire more than just cutting-edge finance and analytics skills. Our guiding principle, "Finance Forward," guarantees that students not only master the latest tools but also develop the judgment to select the appropriate tool for each challenge and the confidence to use it effectively. </span></p><p><span>In every course, students will face complex business challenges, addressing them with fresh analytical methods. After each course, students will record their insights, which will be assembled into an ePortfolio to be presented at the conclusion of the program. Through each course, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of how these tools interconnect and gain a strategic mindset essential for success in Silicon Valley and beyond.</span></p><h3 id="h.ounguhncn0py"><span class=" gdbold">Online MS Business Analytics: Analytics Showdown Competition</span></h3><p><span>The Online MSBA program allows students to participate in a two-week competition. During this competition, they are using actual data from companies within Silicon Valley. They will work with their group members to devise and present solutions to real-world business challenges.</span></p><p><span>The Analytics Showdown embodies an essential truth: today's business analysts and data scientists must use basic and sophisticated tools, techniques, and methods to solve business challenges collaboratively. Of course, mastering these tools is essential, but the key to innovation is refining critical thinking skills to determine the appropriate approach for each situation and business challenge.</span></p><p><span>The competition will provide students with the opportunity to refine their technical knowledge and programming skills acquired throughout the program, including R and Python.
