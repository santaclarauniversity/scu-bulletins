Students develop a breadth of understanding through coursework in accounting, economics, finance, management, marketing, operations management, and information systems, and depth by concentrating electives in functional cross-disciplinary areas. </span></p><p><span>The design of the curriculum was guided by several overarching goals:</span></p><p><span>1) Provide students with the skills and bodies of knowledge that support successful, fulfilling careers in business.</span></p><p><span>2) Alignment with LSB’s primary point of distinction: Engagement with Silicon Valley.</span></p><p><span>3) Strong content related to Entrepreneurship and Innovation (in both new and established firms) and blending theory and practice to help students put ideas into action.</span></p><p><span>4) Commitment to the Jesuit ideals of ethics, integrity, and corporate and individual social responsibility.</span></p><p><span>Program requirements include classes that may include students from the MBA and other M.S. programs, with instruction provided by the same faculty as the MBA program and under the same AACSB accreditation. The online version of the program maintains identical learning objectives and content to the on-campus program, ensuring consistency across platforms.</span></p><a id="kix.1s9vjuvqzour"></a><h2 id="h.ptosn1h4kbnf"><span class=" gdbold">Admissions</span></h2><p><span>For admission information, refer to Chapter 2. </span></p><a id="id.fryd0j514jgd"></a><h2 id="h.o762vrq4tjsk"><span class=" gdbold">MBA Programs Learning Objectives</span></h2><p><span>See the program-specific chapter.</span></p><p><span>After completing the MBA program at Santa Clara University, students will be able to:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_por4yj6aoq26-0 start"><li><span>Describe ethical dilemmas in business, and identify and articulate an ethically justifiable response using appropriate ethical frameworks.

Understand and describe the paths for a successful start-up to evolve into a technology leader.</span></li><li><span>Write clear, well-documented, and effective memoranda and reports.

It holds official recognition from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) program, signifying its emphasis on business acumen intertwined with STEM applications. Graduation requirements for the STEM MBA entail choosing a minimum of 12 elective units from the roster of STEM-approved courses specified within the Data Science and Business Analytics concentration.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">For additional information on online programs, refer to the Online Programs Section in Chapter 6. </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">For additional information on the JD/MBA, refer to the Combined/Dual Degrees Section in Chapter 7.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">For additional academic information policies,  refer to Chapter 5.  </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">For course descriptions and prerequisites for core and electives, refer to Chapter 8.</span></p><h3 id="h.nth4esruw7vz"><span class=" gdbold">Curriculum Clusters </span></h3><p><span class=" gdbold">1.

Electives (26 units)</span></p><p><span>Elective courses serve to broaden a student's understanding within domains relevant to their career and educational objectives. Electives may be taken any time during the program, provided that the necessary prerequisite coursework has been fulfilled. Additionally, electives provide an opportunity to specialize in a specific area, potentially earning a concentration. Any course affiliated with the MBA program, except those mandated by other requirements, qualifies as an elective. As the program evolves, new elective offerings are periodically introduced, and while not all options may be exhaustively listed, nor are all electives available each academic year.</span></p><h3 id="h.5xaduwnd4r88"><span class=" gdbold">Independent Study</span></h3><p><span>Students have the option to pursue independent study to fulfill elective requirements, available in either 2 or 4 unit formats, identified by the course number 3698 (e.g., OMIS 3698, MGMT 3698, etc.). Each student is limited to one independent study course throughout their program. To initiate independent study, students must develop a comprehensive proposal at least one quarter prior to commencing the study. This proposal necessitates review and endorsement by a permanent faculty member, who commits to overseeing and assessing the study. Subsequently, the proposal undergoes evaluation by the department chair for final approval. Following this, it is forwarded to the Graduate Business Programs Office for further review. Prior to registration, a duly signed copy of the proposal must be on record with the Graduate Business Programs Office. Independent study is assessed using the same grading criteria as standard courses.</span></p><a id="kix.ifnooahop1yx"></a><h2 id="h.lnxbz9"><span class=" gdbold">GBP Anywhere Program</span></h2><p><span>The GBP Anywhere Program enables MBA and MS students to enroll in on-campus or online electives from various Graduate Business Programs. This program aims to enhance flexibility and course options for Online and Evening students. Students may take up to 16 units of electives through GBP Anywhere, core courses are not a part of this program.</span></p><p><span>International students are eligible to enroll in one online course per quarter provided they are registered for a minimum of 8 units of classes. However, this allowance does not apply during the first quarter of attendance or to any core classes required by the program. It's important to understand that international students cannot be exclusively enrolled in online courses during their graduating term; they must also be enrolled in at least one on-campus course. Nonetheless, during the Summer quarter, they are permitted to take only an online course. For any updates, questions, or concerns regarding online courses and potential visa implications, please reach out to ISS (International Student Scholars). </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">For additional information, refer to the GBP Anywhere Programs Section in Chapter 6. </span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold"></span></h2><a id="id.h60qiakbyuo5"></a><h2 id="h.wb9cpqirhorq"><span class=" gdbold">Concentrations</span></h2><p><span>Santa Clara University's MBA program offers a broad perspective on business management, while also allowing students the option to specialize through concentrations. Upon successful completion of all requisite courses, the chosen concentration will be reflected on the student's official degree transcript, though it will not be noted on the diploma.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Students are mandated to declare their desired concentration prior to completing 52 units and petitioning to graduate. </span><span>The concentration declaration form is accessible on the Student Services website. It's imperative to declare concentrations before applying for program completion, as those declared afterward will not be recognized.</span></p><p><span>Concentrations require a minimum of 12 elective units within a specific area of focus. Coursework undertaken outside of Santa Clara University does not fulfill concentration requirements.
