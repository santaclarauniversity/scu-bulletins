It holds official recognition from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) program, signifying its emphasis on business acumen intertwined with STEM applications.

Electives (26 units)</span></p><p><span>Elective courses allow students to deepen their understanding of domains relevant to their career and educational goals. These electives can be taken at any point during the program, provided that any necessary prerequisite coursework has been completed. Additionally, electives offer the opportunity to specialize in a specific area, potentially leading to a concentration. Any course affiliated with the MBA program, excluding those required by other program components, qualifies as an elective. As the program continues to evolve, new elective options are introduced periodically. Please note that not all elective offerings may be listed comprehensively, and the availability of specific electives may vary each academic year.Independent Study</span></p><p><span>Students have the option to pursue independent study to fulfill elective requirements, available in either 2 or 4 unit formats, identified by the course number 3698 associated with the department appropriate to the context of the study (e.g.,ISBA</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>3698, MGMT 3698, etc.). Each student is limited to one independent study course throughout their program. To initiate independent study, students must develop a comprehensive proposal at least one quarter prior to commencing the study. This proposal necessitates review and endorsement by a permanent faculty member, who commits to overseeing and assessing the study. Subsequently, the proposal undergoes evaluation by the </span><span>department chair for final approval. </span><span>Following this, it is forwarded to the </span><span>Graduate Business Programs Office for further review. </span><span>Prior to registration, a duly signed copy of the proposal must be on record with the Graduate Business Programs Office. Independent study is assessed using the same grading criteria as standard courses.</span></p><a id="kix.ifnooahop1yx"></a><h2 id="h.lnxbz9"><span class=" gdbold">GBP Anywhere Program</span></h2><p><span>The GBP Anywhere Program enables MBA and MS students to enroll in on-campus or online electives from various Graduate Business Programs. This program aims to enhance flexibility and course options for Online and Evening students. Students may take up to 16 units of electives through GBP Anywhere. Core courses are not a part of this program.</span></p><p><span>International students may enroll in one online course per quarter as long as they are registered for a minimum of 6 units of in-person classes. This option is not available during their first quarter of attendance and does not apply to core courses required by the program. In their final quarter, international students must be enrolled in at least one on-campus course and cannot take only online courses. F-1 visa holders are also required to be enrolled in a minimum of 8 units each quarter.
