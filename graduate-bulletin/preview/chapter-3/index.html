The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is not required to apply for a private alternative educational loan. Private alternative educational loan programs differ from the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program in several ways:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_13-0 start"><li><span>Annual and total loan limits are higher</span></li><li><span>Interest rates are normally variable rates that change on a quarterly basis</span></li><li><span>Loans and interest rates are based on credit approval and approval is not guaranteed</span></li><li><span>Loans are not federally guaranteed; therefore, do not have the same deferments, forbearance, cancellation</span><span>,</span><span> and consolidation benefits as federal student loans</span></li></ul><p><span>The terms and conditions for private alternative educational loans v</span><span>ar</span><span>y greatly. Students are advised to compare loan programs before choosing a lender. Interest rates, fees</span><span>,</span><span> and other provisions of these programs are subject to change by the lender. </span><span>Additional information may be obtained from the OneStop Office located in the Schott Admissions &amp; Enrollment Services Building by calling 408-551-1000 or emailing </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="mailto:onestop@scu.edu">onestop@scu.edu</a></span><span>.</span></p><h3 id="h.gwal6d9j8xl9"><span class=" gdbold">Private Scholarships</span></h3><p><span>If you have been awarded a scholarship from an outside organization, please provide the donor with our contact information. All correspondence and scholarship checks should be sent to the Financial Aid Office.</span></p><h2 id="h.6gjvexxmq8u0"><span class=" gdbold">Financial Aid Eligibility</span></h2><h3 id="h.tngwp1cy6zk3"><span class=" gdbold">Enrollment Status and Financial Aid Eligibility</span></h3><p><span>Graduate students receiving financial aid must meet general University eligibility requirements and any applicable eligibility criteria associated with specific federal, state, or University aid programs from which they are receiving support. Financial aid recipients must make satisfactory academic progress toward a degree and maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0. </span></p><p><span>The U.S. Department of Education has basic eligibility requirements for financial aid, which must be met and maintained in order for a student to be eligible to receive aid. These requirements apply to all federal, state, and Santa Clara University–funded aid. </span></p><h3 id="h.t75qf6edwfnf"><span class=" gdbold">Academic Standing and Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements</span></h3><p><span>All financial aid recipients must maintain good academic standing and be making satisfactory academic progress toward a degree according to the University standards and applicable federal and state regulations. Graduate students are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress at the completion of each academic year (end of spring term).</span></p><h3 id="h.wvcj5t8qg6wa"><span class=" gdbold">Qualitative Standard</span></h3><p><span>Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. </span></p><h3 id="h.h6xvxt9tkce0"><span class=" gdbold">Quantitative Standard</span></h3><p><span>Students must maintain a cumulative 67% completion rate for all units attempted toward their academic programs. Pace is determined by dividing the cumulative number of credits you have earned by the cumulative number of credits you have attempted.</span></p><h3 id="h.w5uw02huphxl"><span class=" gdbold">Maximum Attempted Units Allowed</span></h3><p><span>Students must complete the requirements for their academic programs within 150% of the minimum units required to complete their academic programs (varies by program). Students who have reached their maximum attempted units allowed are ineligible for additional financial aid. Students may appeal for financial aid probation status if they feel their circumstances warrant an exception to this standard.</span></p><h3 id="h.txn84ouxt3of"><span class=" gdbold">Evaluation </span></h3><p><span>All graduate students enrolled at Santa Clara University are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress at the completion of each academic year (end of spring term).</span></p><h3 id="h.vk8d2mp88y1"><span class=" gdbold">Pass/No Pass</span></h3><p><span>Courses with Pass grades will count toward your total hours for the cumulative completion rate for federal financial aid. However, Pass grades will not count in your GPA calculation. Courses that earn NP grades will count as attempted but not completed, and could impact your eligibility for federal aid. P/NP options may not be available in all graduate programs. Graduate students should refer to their program office for additional guidance.</span></p><h3 id="h.8ajphivy0tt0"><span class=" gdbold">Repetition of Courses</span></h3><p><span>Graduate students should contact their program office to discuss options for repeating courses. </span></p><p><span>In most cases, if repeated courses are allowed, the repeated course is used in the calculation of the student's grade point average (This may not be the case for all programs. Please check with your program office).</span></p><p><span>Units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed.</span></p><h3 id="h.cj20gvhalh1q"><span class=" gdbold">Course Incompletes, Withdrawals, Failures, and/or Repetitions</span></h3><p><span>Incompletes (I), Withdrawals (W), Failures (F), and/or repeated courses will adversely affect a student's completion rate. Students must complete the minimum number of units to fulfill federal, state, and University requirements. Completion rates are calculated cumulatively and will include all quarters/semesters that the student was enrolled, whether or not the student received financial aid.</span></p><p><span>Students who wish to withdraw from Santa Clara University must contact their graduate school advisor. Depending on your date of withdrawal, you may automatically be assigned a withdrawal grade (W) and may not be eligible for a tuition refund. Your program advisor will advise on what you can expect and/or what to be prepared for. </span></p><p><span>Students who abandon their classes will receive a failing grade, impacting their qualitative and quantitative SAP requirements.</span></p><p><span>Students who withdraw from their program are still responsible for any financial commitment made to both the university and loan provider(s).</span></p><p><span>IMPORTANT: Any student leaving Santa Clara University at the conclusion of any quarter should also contact their graduate program.</span></p><h3 id="h.xt21qvsbjm1u"><span class=" gdbold">Appeal Process</span></h3><p><span>There could be extenuating circumstances encountered by students that may affect their ability to be academically successful during an enrollment period. These circumstances include personal injury or illness that occurs during an enrollment period; death of an immediate family member or legal guardian during an enrollment period; or other documented circumstances that were unexpected in nature and beyond control of the student. In these cases, cumulative grade point average or completion rate may decline resulting in the student not meeting the minimum qualitative and quantitative standards previously described. If you wish to appeal your financial aid suspension, a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office. If the appeal is approved, the student will be placed on financial aid probation (separate from academic probation) and will be notified of the appeal results in writing. </span></p><h3 id="h.w3v6o0ycqccl"><span class=" gdbold">Loss of Eligibility </span></h3><p><span>Students who have lost eligibility to participate in federal, state, and University aid programs for reasons of academic progress, can regain that eligibility only by enrolling at Santa Clara University at their own expense. The mere passage of time will not restore eligibility to a student who has lost eligibility for failure to make satisfactory academic progress. Students who have been dismissed from Santa Clara University for academic reasons, but who are subsequently readmitted are not automatically eligible to participate in federal, state, or institutional aid programs and will be placed on financial aid warning/or suspension. Re-admission decisions are separate from funding decisions.</span></p><h3 id="h.6gtq3q4zwa0s"><span class=" gdbold">Regaining Eligibility </span></h3><p><span>Students who fail to meet satisfactory academic progress and who choose to enroll without financial aid may request a review of their academic record after any term in which they are enrolled without the receipt of financial aid. If the standards are met at the time of review, eligibility may be regained for subsequent terms of enrollment in the academic year.</span></p><h3><span class=" gdbold">Deadlines</span></h3><p><span>The Financial Aid Office has established deadlines for the programs it administers. All students requesting financial aid from the University should contact the </span><span>OneStop Office</span><span> at the earliest possible date and request specific deadline information and appropriate application materials. All financial aid deadlines are posted on the </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="http://www.scu.edu/financialaid">Financial Aid website</a></span><span>. The </span><span>OneStop Office</span><span> and the Financial Aid Office communicate with students through SCU email addresses only.</span></p><h3><span class=" gdbold">Veterans and Veterans’ Dependents Assistance</span></h3><p><span>Santa Clara University is certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 percent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill), Chapter 33 (post 9/11 GI Bill®). Individuals interested in attending under any of the veterans’ assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar at 408-554-7831.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Return of Federal Title IV Funds</span></h2><p><span>All students who withdraw completely from the University and who have federal financial aid, including federal student loans, are subject to the return of Title IV funds policy. Under this policy, it is assumed that a student earns </span><span>their</span><span> aid based on the period of time </span><span>they remain</span><span> enrolled. Unearned Title IV funds, other than federal work-study, must be returned to the federal aid programs. Unearned aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV aid that exceeds the amount of earned Title IV aid.</span></p><p><span>During the first 60 percent of the enrollment period, a student earns Title IV funds </span><span>directly proportional</span><span> to </span><span>their enrollment length</span><span>. That is, the percentage of time during the period that the student remained enrolled is the percentage of </span><span>disbursable</span><span> aid for that period that the student earned. Institutional costs </span><span>do not determine</span><span> the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period.</span></p><p><span>All funds must be returned to federal programs before being returned to </span><span>the </span><span>state or institutional aid programs and/or the student. This return of funds allocation will be made in the following specific order and will be applied to all students who have received federal Title IV assistance:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_12-0 start"><li><span>Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans </span></li><li><span>Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans</span></li><li><span>Other Federal, State, private or institutional assistance programs</span></li></ul><h2><span class=" gdbold">Verification of Information</span></h2><p><span>The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students submit as a basis for aid awards. Each year, a percentage of students receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected </span><span>to verify</span><span> the information on which awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds.</span></p></body>
