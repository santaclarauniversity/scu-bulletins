Strategic Analysis</span></h3><p><span>This course focuses on the processes by which managers position their businesses to develop and sustain an advantage relative to rivals in the face of uncertainty, rapid change, and competition. Strategy involves understanding the utility of different choices and tradeoffs – choosing what not to do is as important as choosing what to do. As a result, the course covers a variety of tools, frameworks, theories and concepts for analyzing a firm’s strategic position and the environment in which it is operating to inform the strategic decision</span><span>-</span><span>making process. By</span><span> covering </span><span>the factors that make some strategic positions strong and viable, students will develop the ability to evaluate the effects of changes in resources </span><span>and</span><span> capabilities, industry forces, macro environmental forces, and technology on industry structure and firm behavior and, in turn, on a firm’s opportunities for</span><span> creating, capturing and sustaining</span><span> a superior strategic position relative to rivals. The course also requires that students integrate and extend the knowledge and skills they have developed throughout their MBA program course work (i.e. marketing, finance, economics, organizational behavior, ethics, information systems, accounting, etc.) into a “total” business perspective. Analyzing real world situations best facilitates this activity; therefore, case analysis plays a large role in the course. Students will develop skills in</span><span> f</span><span>ormulating viable and defensible strategies and in evaluating the strategic choices and options. </span><span>(4 units)</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Prerequisite: </span><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Must complete all core courses excluding MGMT 3060 Business and the Common Good.</span></p><h3 id="h.55e0g4elnial"><span class=" gdbold"></span></h3><h3 id="h.ru8x5k49epx"><span class=" gdbold">MGMT 3052.
