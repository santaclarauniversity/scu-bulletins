Students will learn essential matrix operations, vector spaces, eigenvalues, least squares regression, and dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The course also introduces Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and explores how neural networks leverage matrix computations. Rather than focusing on deep theoretical proofs, this course emphasizes intuitive understanding and hands-on implementation using Python (NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn). By the end of the course, students will be able to apply linear algebra concepts to real-world datasets and build a strong foundation for further studies in data science, AI, and machine learning.

Data analytics requires knowledge and skills from three areas: (i) programming, (ii) math/statistics, and (iii) domain specific expertise. The objective of this course is to teach the programming skills relevant to data science. Students will learn to use a complete set of open source tools for data science in Python, including the Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Colab, and many others. Students will learn skills that cover the various phases of exploratory data analysis: importing data, cleaning and transforming data, algorithmic thinking, grouping, aggregation, reshaping, visualization, time series, statistical modeling, and data exploration and communication of results. The course will utilize data from a wide range of sources and will culminate with a final project and presentation.

The objective of this course is to convey intermediate to advanced database concepts and to acquaint students with state-of-the-art software tools. The course will rely on classroom discussions, media articles and cases, as well as programming exercises and an integrative group project. Use of database software is required. A lab fee is required. Introduces database management and database management systems (DBMS). Teaches technical and managerial skills in database planning, analysis, logical design, physical design, implementation, and maintenance. Features hands-on training in database design, development, and implementation using relational DBMS software. Emphasizes designing and developing reliable databases to support organizational management.
