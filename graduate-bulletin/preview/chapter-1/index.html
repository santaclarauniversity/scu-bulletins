The development of competence is reflected in our commitment to teaching excellence and the scholarly research necessary to animate instruction and foster </span><span>knowledge creation</span><span>. The development of conscience is enhanced through an emphasis on reflective inquiry that is both professionally rigorous and ethically sound. Compassion is at the intersection of competence </span><span>and conscience</span><span>, fostered through an appreciation of multiple perspectives and recognition of the human being as part of every equation.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Mission Statement of the Graduate Business Programs Office</span></h2><p><span>S</span><span>anta Clara </span><span>University’s Leavey School of Business Graduate</span><span> Business Programs team</span><span> strives to provide a transformative student-centered experience by being supportive, compassionate, and inclusive at all points in a student’s educational journey. We aspire to create student success with opportunities to network with faculty, fellow students, and alumni. With collaboration across career, program, and admissions teams, GBP will enable students to be socially conscious, ethically minded, and those who understand how to lead themselves and others. </span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Graduate Business Programs Learning Objectives:</span></h2><ol class="lst-kix_ma7xgbtdvqpn-0 start" start="1"><li><span>Demonstrate academic competence: Graduate students will demonstrate broad content knowledge and the ability to integrate and apply concepts from their course of study to professional situations.</span></li><li><span>Engage in creative and collaborative learning: Graduate students will innovate, collaborate, and communicate effectively with professionals and others in their discipline.</span></li><li><span>Enhance professional development: Graduate students will exhibit professionalism, consistent with the University’s Jesuit mission, which includes attentio</span><span>n to</span><span> ethics, integrity, and responsible engagement with their communities—professionally, locally, or globally.”</span></li></ol><h2><span class=" gdbold">MBA Programs Learning Objectives</span></h2><p><span>See the program-specific chapter.</span></p><h2 id="h.7ihfvwbx7uj8"><span class=" gdbold">MS Programs Learning Objectives</span></h2><p><span>See the program-specific chapter.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Professional Orientation</span></h2><p><span>The </span><span>Graduate Business</span><span> Programs at Santa Clara University </span><span>are</span><span> </span><span>explicitly designed</span><span> to meet the needs and concerns of working professionals. </span><span>Classes are scheduled in the evening or on weekends to</span><span> allow students to pursue their </span><span>graduate business</span><span> degrees while continuing their careers</span><span>. </span><span>The curriculum blends instruction in theory with practical applications, enriched by faculty experts (who engage in </span><span>state-of-the-art</span><span> research </span><span>or have deep industry experience) and </span><span>students whose curiosity is informed by real-life organizational concerns.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Academic Standards</span></h2><p><span>Santa Clara’s </span><span>Graduate Business</span><span> Programs </span><span>are renowned</span><span> for quality, providing academic rigor and practical relevance. Admission standards are selective, as courses are demanding</span><span>,</span><span> and faculty and fellow students </span><span>have</span><span> high expectations, although the atmosphere </span><span>remains</span><span> collegial and not competitive. While the MBA and MS degrees </span><span>are</span><span> considered final professional degrees, we look to admit students focused on receiving an education, not simply a piece of paper, for their time and effort. Students should be prepared for an intensive course of study encompassing all the major functional and disciplinary areas and involving quantitative and qualitative skills. Similarly, students pursuing an MS degree should expect rigorous and relevant coursework </span><span>with a more narrow</span><span> </span><span>scope</span><span>. </span><span>Regardless of the</span><span> program, students demonstrating curiosity, engagement, and a collaborative spirit reap</span><span> </span><span>the greatest benefits.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Accreditation</span></h2><p><span>Santa Clara University was in the original group of MBA programs in 1961</span><span>,</span><span> accredited by AACSB International–the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The AACSB is the specialized accrediting organization that conducts periodic in-depth reviews of business schools to ensure that their curricula, faculty, and students meet the highest standards of excellence. Re-accredited in 20</span><span>21</span><span>, Santa Clara’s program has consistently met the high standards of the AACSB. Less than 1</span><span>0</span><span>% of the world’s 13,000 business programs have earned AACSB Accreditation. Santa Clara is also accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). Such regional accreditation is a prerequisite for the specialized program accreditation provided by AACSB International.</span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Student Body</span></h2><p><span>Over</span><span> </span><span>700 </span><span>students are enrolled in the MBA and M.S. Programs. Entering MBA students represent a variety of undergraduate and graduate fields of study. MBA students, on average, have </span><span>7</span><span> years of work experience at </span><span>the </span><span>time of admission. The average grade point average of entering MBA students is 3.3, and the average GMAT score is 6</span><span>20</span><span>. This blend of academic backgrounds and work experience provides opportunities for enhanced learning in and out of the classroom.</span></p><p><span>Many of our MBA students are working professionals – people who work </span><span>full-time</span><span> in local companies and take three to four courses each quarter. Students come from more than 500 organizations that comprise a list of Silicon Valley’s most vibrant businesses.</span><span> Additionally, many of our M.S. students are international students who add to the diversity of our community. Our Online Programs have students from over 10 different states enrolled. </span></p><h2><span class=" gdbold">Alumni</span></h2><p><span>Since 1961, more than</span><span> </span><span>15,000</span><span> </span><span>students</span><span> have received their MBA or M.S. degrees from Santa Clara University. As one of the first MBA programs accredited by AACSB International, SCU’s Leavey School of Business has been educating the next generation of leaders who </span><span>have shaped</span><span> our world for decades. Among our </span><span>u</span><span>niversity </span><span>alums</span><span> are more than 2,000 company presidents and senior corporate executives, </span><span>and </span><span>many are leaders in global technology companies. </span><span>In addition, our</span><span> graduates have </span><span>become</span><span> leaders in Fortune 500 firms, </span><span>startups,</span><span> early growth companies, </span><span>and</span><span> family and non-profit organizations. The high regard for the </span><span>Leavey School’s</span><span> MBA and M.S. degrees </span><span>is also</span><span> reflected in the number of Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay Area companies </span><span>with</span><span> a relationship with the university.</span></p><p><span>V</span><span>arious net</span><span>working</span><span> events for and with </span><span>alums occur throughout the year</span><span>. These events are designed to provide opportunities to connect with fellow </span><span>alums</span><span>, faculty, and staff</span><span> and</span><span> provide </span><span>lifelong</span><span> learning forums. Leavey School of Business </span><span>alums</span><span> </span><span>actively participate</span><span> in these networking events. </span><span>In addition, they</span><span> serve on information panels, welcome new </span><span>alumni</span><span> at commencement, host local reunions, share their stories with prospective students, and participate in coaching students through our professional institutes and clubs. </span></p><p><span>The Leavey School of Business is proud to have an engaged MBA Alumni Advisory Board.
