Students develop a breadth of understanding through coursework in accounting, economics, finance, management, marketing, operations management, and information systems, and depth by concentrating electives in functional cross-disciplinary areas. </span><span>The online version of the program maintains identical program learning objectives and content as the on-campus program. </span></p><p><span>The design of the curriculum was guided by several overarching goals:</span></p><ol class="lst-kix_list_11-0 start" start="1"><li><span>Provide students with the skills and bodies of knowledge that support successful, fulfilling careers in business.</span></li><li><span>Alignment with LSB’s primary point of distinction: Engagement with Silicon Valley.</span></li><li><span>Strong content related to Entrepreneurship and Innovation (in both new and established firms) and blending theory and practice to help students put ideas into action.</span></li><li><span>Commitment to the Jesuit ideals of ethics, integrity, and corporate and individual social responsibility.</span></li></ol><p><span>Program requirements are completed with classes that may also include students from the online MBA program and MS programs. The same faculty teach in the MBA program as our MS programs. Both MBA programs are accredited by theAssociation to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business’s </span><span>(AACSB) </span><span>international accreditation. </span></p><a id="kix.ra6qzajbui4h"></a><h2 id="h.aonchwntr4ma"><span class=" gdbold">Admissions</span></h2><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">For admission requirements, please refer to Chapter 2.

While entering students have a  recommended schedule for their first year, there is considerable flexibility in the pace and order in which courses are taken (with the caveat that all prerequisites must be satisfied before enrolling in a particular course).  </span></p><p><span>The STEM MBA program follows the same 70 unit curriculum and course schedules as the MBA program and has been designated as a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and reflects a curricular focus on business skills with an emphasis on STEM applications. To complete the STEM MBA, a minimum of 12 elective units must be selected from the STEM-approved courses listed in the Data Science and Business Analytics concentration.</span></p><p><span>The Online MBA follows the same 70 unit curriculum as the Evening MBA program. </span><span class=" gdbold">Online student should refer to additional information in Chapter 6.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">For information on the JD/MBA, please refer to the Combined/Dual Degrees section in Chapter 7.</span></p><a id="id.qw1vvbr7fpla"></a><h2><span class=" gdbold">Evening &amp; STEM MBA Schedules</span></h2><p><span>During the fall, winter, spring, and summer quarters, 4-unit classes generally meet twice per week for ten weeks for 95 minutes per session. The 2-unit courses generally meet twice per week for five weeks covering the first or second half of a quarter. Some elective courses are scheduled for weekend sessions throughout the term. In all quarters, the final exam periods are two hours.</span></p><a id="id.m1mvlzdibgdy"></a><h2 id="h.30j0zll"><span class=" gdbold">Online MBA Schedule </span></h2><p><span>The Online MBA Program will be largely asynchronous in learning materials such as readings, lecture videos, individual assignments, discussions, quizzes, and exams. However, courses may also involve a variety of group projects, group discussions, or office hours, requiring students to schedule some synchronous conversations with their group mates and/or professors. A few elective courses require students to attend live, synchronous learning session. Students are notified at registration if the course requires synchronous sessions. </span></p><p><span></span></p><h3 id="h.dy0y8kujkhrg"><span class=" gdbold">Residency</span></h3><p><span>The Online MBA program requires a </span><span>3.5-day</span><span> on-campus residency at the start OF THE PROGRAM, which includes MGMT 3000 required course. The program concludes with MGMT 3060, also a 3-day, on-campus residency experience. Both residency experiences require coursework prior to and after the weekend. </span><span class=" gdbold gditalic">See Chapter 6 for more information regarding online programs.</span></p><h3 id="h.1fob9te"><span class=" gdbold">Silicon Valley Dashboard</span></h3><p><span>Designed to help turn ordinary professionals into Silicon Valley Professionals (SVPs), the Online MBA program provides a curriculum based in innovation and principled leadership. Throughout their </span><span><a href="https://onlinedegrees.scu.edu/media/blog/preparing-silicon-valley-leaders-for-success">SVP Journey</a></span><span>, students will be able to track their progress with the </span><span><a href="https://onlinedegrees.scu.edu/experience/silicon-valley-professional-student-experience">Silicon Valley Professional dashboard</a></span><span>. This integrative portfolio lets participants coordinate their elective courses and co-curricular experiences with their professional goals and invites them to reflect on their professional development during the program. The dashboard also acts as a networking resource, allowing students to interact with instructors, classmates, and mentors, and it provides a way for them to solicit and receive feedback on their current progress.</span></p><a id="id.jwe9mr9frusa"></a><h2 id="h.a0edtj3sap09"><span class=" gdbold">Program Outline</span></h2><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Students should refer to Chapter 5 regarding additional academic information policies.

Electives may be taken any time during the program, assuming the prerequisite coursework is complete. Electives can also be used to earn a concentration in a particular area. Any course offered in conjunction with the MBA program, with the exception of those otherwise required, is considered an elective. New courses are continually being developed and all elective options may not be listed, nor is every elective offered every </span><span>academic</span><span> year. </span></p><h3 id="h.5xaduwnd4r88"><span class=" gdbold">Independent Study</span></h3><p><span>A student may elect to register for independent study to fulfill an elective requirement (2 or 4 units). Independent study courses are numbered 3698 (e.g., OMIS 3698, MGMT 3698, etc.). A student may take only one independent study course during their program. To obtain permission to register for independent study, students should prepare a complete proposal at least one quarter in advance of the quarter in which they wish to undertake the study. The proposal must be reviewed and signed by a permanent faculty member who thereby agrees to supervise and evaluate the study. The proposal is then reviewed by the department chair who must approve the proposal. The proposal must then be submitted to the Graduate Business Programs Office for final review. A signed copy of the proposal must be on file with the Graduate Business Programs Office before registration. An independent study is graded in the same manner as all other courses.</span></p><a id="kix.ifnooahop1yx"></a><h2 id="h.lnxbz9"><span class=" gdbold">GBP Anywhere Program</span></h2><p><span>The GBP Anywhere Program allows MBA and MS students to take on-campus or online electives from other Graduate Business Programs. The GBP Anywhere Program will offer greater flexibility and course availability for all Online and Evening students.  Evening MBA students may take up to 16 units of elective credit in the Online MBA program and vice versa as long as the student has met the prerequisites.
