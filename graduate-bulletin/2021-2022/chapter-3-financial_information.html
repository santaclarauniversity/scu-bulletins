<h2 id="billing-and-payment-procedures">Billing and Payment Procedures</h2>
<h3 id="student-accounts-and-billing">Student Accounts and Billing</h3>
<p>Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrolling at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures. Students may designate a third party (e.g. spouse, parent, family member) to be an Authorized Payer for the purpose of reviewing the student account and billing information and remitting payment on their behalf. However, it is still the student&apos;s responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the published deadlines. Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through University eCampus. A billing notification will be sent to the student&apos;s assigned SCU gmail account and to the e-mail address of any Authorized Payer. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remitting payment. In compliance with FERPA, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, Santa Clara University is prohibited from providing your student financial and non-directory academic information to a third party including parents, spouse, guardian, etc., without a release. This information includes, but is not limited to, all student billing items, awarded financial aid, enrollment status and various student financial or academic information. Students can complete the FERPA information through eCampus. Log into eCampus, click the Academic tile, click FERPA release, and complete the required information.</p>
<p>Students are obligated to pay their applicable tuition and fees by the published term payment deadline. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to pre-pay for tuition before enrollment is granted. <strong>Registered students who do not formally withdraw from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their account, as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees.</strong></p>

<h3 id="payment-methods">Payment Methods</h3>

Please visit our Bursar&apos;s office website for additional payment information: <a href="https://www.scu.edu/bursar/paymentoptions/" target="_blank">https://www.scu.edu/bursar/paymentoptions/</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Payment by Electronic Check</strong></p>
<p>A student or Authorized Payer can make online payments by processing a fund transfer directly from his/her <em>personal</em> checking or savings account through our third-party vendor&apos;s website accessible via the University eCampus system SCU Pay Site. Please note that a bank may reject a fund transfer if it exceeds a specific amount. Check with your bank about daily limits to prevent returned payment transactions. Payers are able to make electronic check payments online without incurring a transaction fee.</p>
<p><strong>Payment by Mail</strong></p>
<p>Payment for student account charges can be mailed to the University&apos;s cash management service lockbox. Please enclose a copy of the billing statement with your paper or cashier&apos;s check made payable to Santa Clara University and mail both items to: SCU Payment Processing, PO Box 550, Santa Clara CA 95052-0550.</p>
<p><strong>Payment In Person</strong></p>
<p>Payments for student account charges may be made in person by personal/cashier&apos;s check, money order or cash at the OneStop office located in the Admissions &amp; Enrollment Services Building. There are computer kiosks located in the OneStop office for the convenience of students and payers to make online payments. The University does not accept debit or credit card payments for student account charges.</p>
<p><strong>International Payment by Wire Transfer</strong></p>
<p>International students may submit payment quickly and securely through eCampus. Authorized Payers and other third-party payers can make payments by accessing the following link: <a href="https://payment.flywire.com/pay/payment" target="_blank">https://payment.flywire.com/pay/payment</a> .. Students are able to benefit from excellent exchange rates and payment can usually be made in the student&apos;s home currency.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p>
<p>Currently enrolled students may be eligible to enroll in a monthly payment plan to assist with budgeting needs. The online <em>only</em> monthly payment plan can be accessed by logging into eCampus and selecting the Financial Account Tile. There is a $40 non-refundable enrollment fee each quarter and students must have a US bank account to enroll in the term plan.The first payment along with the enrollment fee are due upon enrollment and all subsequent payments will be processed automatically each month thereafter. Plans are subject to rebalancing based upon changes in enrollment and/or financial aid. Participants must enroll each quarter; there is no automatic re-enrollment. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar&apos;s Office website: <a href="http://www.scu.edu/bursar/paymentoptions/paymentplan" target="_blank">www.scu.edu/bursar</a></p>
<h3 id="delinquent-payments">Delinquent Payments</h3>
<p>If all charges on a student&apos;s account are not cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement by the payment deadline, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student&apos;s account and a hold will be placed on the student&apos;s record. A hold on a student&apos;s record prevents the release of diplomas and certifications, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default, in accordance with California state law.</p>
<p>Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recovering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be <strong>paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University.</strong></p>
<h3 id="refunds-for-credit-balances">Refunds for Credit Balances</h3>
<p>Refunds will be granted only for student accounts reflecting a credit balance. A refund will not be granted based on anticipated aid. All financial aid must be disbursed on to a student&apos;s account before a refund is processed. It is the student&apos;s responsibility to make sure all necessary documentation is complete and submitted to the Financial Aid Office so that aid can be disbursed properly and in a timely fashion. Payment received by personal check will have a 14 calendar day hold before a refund can be issued; electronic check payments require a 7 calendar day hold. Additional information related to refund policies can be found on the Bursar&apos;s website: <a href="http://www.scu.edu/bursar/refund" target="_blank">www.scu.edu/bursar/refund</a></p>
<h3 id="billing-disputes">Billing Disputes</h3>
<p>If a student wishes to dispute any charges on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar&apos;s Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar&apos;s Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the item in question appeared. Communication can be made by telephone, but doing so will not preserve the student&apos;s rights.</p>
<p>Communication should include the student&apos;s name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress; all other items not in question must be paid by the due date. If the amount in question is found to be correct, payment must be submitted to the Bursar&apos;s Office immediately upon notification.</p>
<h2 id="tuition-refund-policy">Tuition Refund Policy</h2>
<p>Students who formally withdraw from the University or drop courses are eligible for tuition refunds in accordance with the policies outlined below. No refunds are made for any fees. Certain graduate programs do not follow the Bursar&apos;s Refund policy. Please be sure to refer to your academic calendar or contact the Record&apos;s office for additional information.

Unearned Title IV funds, other than federal work-study, must be returned to the federal aid programs. Unearned aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV aid that exceeds the amount of earned Title IV aid.</p>
<p>During the first 60 percent of the enrollment period, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the period that the student remained enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student earned. Institutional costs play no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled</p>
<p>A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period.</p>
<p>All funds must be returned to federal programs before being returned to state or institutional aid programs and/or the student. This return of funds allocation will be made in the following specific order and will be applied to all students who have received federal Title IV assistance:</p>

<h2 id="verification-of-information">Verification of Information</h2>
<p>The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students submit as a basis for aid awards. Each year, a percentage of students receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the information on which awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds.</p>
