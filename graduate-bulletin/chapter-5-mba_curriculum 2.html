<p><em>Note: Refer to designated chapters for curriculum details specific to the Masters of Science in Information Systems, Finance &amp; Analytics, Business Analytics, Executive MBA, and Online Programs.</em></p>
<p>The Santa Clara MBA program is designed to develop leaders with a broad business, economic, and social perspective who are capable of managing change in dynamic environments. Students develop a breadth of understanding through coursework in accounting, economics, finance, management, marketing, and operations management and information systems; and depth by concentrating electives in functional cross-disciplinary areas.</p>
<h2 id="program-design">Program Design</h2>
<p>The design of the curriculum was guided by several overarching goals:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Provide students with the skills and bodies of knowledge that support successful, fulfilling careers in business.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Alignment with LSB&apos;s primary point of distinction: Engagement with Silicon Valley.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Strong content related to Entrepreneurship and Innovation (in both new and established firms) and blending theory and practice to help students put ideas into action.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Commitment to the Jesuit ideals of ethics, integrity and corporate and individual social responsibility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="overview-of-curriculum">Overview of Curriculum</h2>
<p>The Santa Clara MBA curriculum consists of 70 units across 14 core courses (44 units) and 26 additional units of free electives. While entering students have a recommended schedule for their first year, there is considerable flexibility in the pace and order in which courses are taken (with the caveat that all prerequisites must be satisfied before enrolling in a particular course). Please note that the Evening MBA and Online MBA programs follow the same curriculum and requirements.</p>
<p>The STEM MBA program follows the same 70 unit curriculum and course schedules as the MBA program and has been designated as a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and reflects a curricular focus on business skills with an emphasis on STEM applications. To complete the STEM MBA, a minimum of 12 elective units must be selected from the STEM-approved courses listed in the Data Science and Business Analytics concentration.</p>
<h2 id="schedules">Schedules</h2>
<p>During the fall, winter, spring, and summer quarters, 4-unit classes generally meet twice per week for ten weeks for 95 minutes per session. The 2-unit courses generally meet twice per week for five weeks covering the first or second half of a quarter. Some elective courses are scheduled for weekend sessions throughout the term. In all quarters, final exam periods are two hours.</p>

<p>Elective courses expand a student&apos;s knowledge in areas of particular interest or importance to the student&apos;s career and educational goals. Electives may be taken any time during the program, assuming the prerequisite coursework is complete. Electives can also be used to earn a concentration in a particular area. Any course offered in conjunction with the MBA program, with the exception of those otherwise required, is considered an elective. For descriptions of elective courses, please consult Chapter 12. New courses are continually being developed and all elective options may not be listed.</p>
<h3 id="independent-study">Independent Study</h3>
<p>A student may elect to register for independent study to fulfill an elective requirement (2 or 4 units). Independent study courses are numbered 3698 (e.g., OMIS 3698, MGMT 3698, etc.). A student may take only one independent study course during their program. To obtain permission to register for independent study, students should prepare a complete proposal at least one quarter in advance of the quarter in which they wish to undertake the study. The proposal must be reviewed and signed by a tenured faculty member who thereby agrees to supervise and evaluate the study. The proposal is then reviewed by the department chair who must approve the proposal. The proposal must then be submitted to the Graduate Business Programs Office for final review. A signed copy of the proposal must be on file with the Graduate Business Programs Office before registration. An independent study is graded in the same manner as all other courses.</p>

<p>A student is required to declare their intended concentration <strong>during or before the term in which they reach 52 completed program units</strong>. The concentration declaration form can be found on the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/business/graduate-degrees/student-services/academic/forms/" target="_blank">Student Services website</a>.</p>
<p>Concentrations require at least 12 elective units in a specific area, and coursework completed outside of Santa Clara University does not satisfy concentration requirements. See below for more information.</p>
