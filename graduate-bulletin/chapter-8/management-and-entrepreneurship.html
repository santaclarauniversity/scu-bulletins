Leading People and Organizations</span></h3><p><span>Provides students with theories, frameworks, and empirical research on the topic of leadership and team dynamics to help students enhance their own leadership capabilities. Topics include empirically-grounded models of leadership, importance of self-awareness in leadership, effective group &amp; team dynamics, group decision-making, conflict resolution, and design thinking</span><span>. </span><span>(</span><span>4 units)</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Prerequisites: None.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic"></span></p><h3 id="h.wwjnub55vy38"><span class=" gdbold">MGMT 3050. Strategic Analysis</span></h3><p><span>This course focuses on the processes by which managers position their businesses to develop and sustain an advantage relative to rivals in the face of uncertainty, rapid change, and competition. Strategy involves understanding the utility of different choices and tradeoffs – choosing what not to do is as important as choosing what to do. As a result, the course covers a variety of tools, frameworks, theories and concepts for analyzing a firm’s strategic position and the environment in which it is operating to inform the strategic decision</span><span>-</span><span>making process. By</span><span> covering </span><span>the factors that make some strategic positions strong and viable, students will develop the ability to evaluate the effects of changes in resources </span><span>and</span><span> capabilities, industry forces, macro environmental forces, and technology on industry structure and firm behavior and, in turn, on a firm’s opportunities for</span><span> creating, capturing and sustaining</span><span> a superior strategic position relative to rivals. The course also requires that students integrate and extend the knowledge and skills they have developed throughout their MBA program course work (i.e. marketing, finance, economics, organizational behavior, ethics, information systems, accounting, etc.) into a “total” business perspective. Analyzing real world situations best facilitates this activity; therefore, case analysis plays a large role in the course. Students will develop skills in</span><span> f</span><span>ormulating viable and defensible strategies and in evaluating the strategic choices and options. </span><span>(4 units)</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Prerequisite: </span><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Must complete all core.</span></p><h3 id="h.ru8x5k49epx"><span class=" gdbold">MGMT 3052.

The course utilizes the common good perspective and framework for analyzing within the context of business decision making a variety of issues facing employees and organizations. The course will grapple head-on with tradeoffs and tensions between competing goods and with both the intended and the unintended consequences (in the short- and long-term) of decisions and actions at the individual, group, organizational, and broader societal level.(4 units)</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Prerequisite: </span><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Must complete all core and is taken in near the end of the program.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic"></span></p><h3 id="h.xnp0bh151d85"><span class=" gdbold">MGMT 3200.

Understanding and Embracing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at Work</span></h3><p><span>This class will be covering sensitive topics. Students who enroll should be ready to embrace opportunities to engage in difficult, challenging conversations. Active participation is required to do well in the class. Thanks to globalization, changing social norms, and growing acceptance of remote work, we are living in an increasingly diverse world. Our colleagues and customers differ in a variety of ways including race, religion, gender, sexuality, nationality, cognitive and physical abilities, beliefs, and age. Multiple studies have found that diversity in organizations is associated with financial growth, greater innovation, and enhanced alignment with needs of customers. But diversity only yields these benefits when the workplace is truly equitable and inclusive. While there are several challenges that inhibit inclusion, one of the most prevalent is unconscious bias. The key word is "unconscious". People who are truly committed to building an inclusive environment may inadvertently act in a way that is divisive. This course will focus on a subset of diverse characteristics: race and gender. We'll start with a demonstration of how Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) contribute to the success of organizations. After exploring then concept of implicit bias and our own biases, we'll study how the workplace can be experienced differently by underrepresented groups. Awareness is the beginning. The next step will be examining ways to increase diversity, improve equity and create inclusive work </span><span>spaces -personally and </span><span>organizationally.
