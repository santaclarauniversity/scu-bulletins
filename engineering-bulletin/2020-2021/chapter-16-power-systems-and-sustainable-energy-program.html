<p><em>Program Advisor: Dr. Maryam Khanbaghi</em></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Twenty-first century problems demand holistic thinking to effectively address the social, environmental, and economic impact of emerging energy technologies. We offer a graduate certificate in Renewable Energy and a multi-disciplinary master&#x2019;s degree in Power Systems and Sustainable Energy. Both offerings balance deep technical expertise with practical application experience, while also promoting understanding of the economics, public policy, and ethics that shape the industry. A broad and ever-increasing range of courses&#x2014;power systems, smart grid, energy management, security, and infrastructure, to name a few&#x2014;are complemented by lectures, workshops, and field trips offered quarterly by our energetic Energy Club. Fuel your passion for energy engineering as you train alongside Silicon Valley professionals to meet the changing demands in energy and fulfill a pressing need in the rapidly growing renewable energy market in our Valley and the world.</p>
<h2 id="masters-degree-program-and-requirements">Master&#x2019;s Degree Program And Requirements</h2>
<p>Students interested in this major must satisfy the standard admissions criteria used by the School of Engineering, which include an undergraduate degree in a field of engineering (physics degrees will also be considered), appropriate GRE scores and (for international students) demonstrated proficiency in English. Both TOEFL and IELTS scores are acceptable for this purpose. All students are expected to maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.0 while enrolled in the program. They must also develop a PS&amp;SE Program of Studies with the program advisor and file this document with the Graduate Programs Office by the end of their first quarter at SCU.</p>

<h2 id="renewable-energy-certificate-program">Renewable Energy Certificate Program</h2>
<p>The main goal of this certificate is to introduce students to the field of renewable energy. The intent is to help equip professionals in Silicon Valley with the knowledge that will help them advance in their present career or enter the renewable energy field. To enroll in this certificate, an applicant should have a B.S. in Engineering from an accredited school and maintain a grade point average of 3.0. As with most certificates in the Graduate School of Engineering, the requirement is 16 quarter units. Eight of these units are in Power Systems and eight units are in Renewable Energy.</p>
<h3 id="continuation-for-a-masters-degree">Continuation For A Master&#x2019;s Degree</h3>
<p>All Santa Clara University graduate courses applied to the completion of a certificate program earn graduate credit that may also be applied toward a graduate degree. Students who wish to continue for such a degree must submit a separate application and satisfy all standard admission requirements. The general GRE test requirement for graduate admission to the master&#x2019;s degree will be waived for students who complete a certificate program with a GPA of 3.5 or better. </p>
