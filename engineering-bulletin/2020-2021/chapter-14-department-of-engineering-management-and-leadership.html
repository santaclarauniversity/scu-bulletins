<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Engineering Management and Leadership (EMGT) program is designed for both engineering students and professionals who wish to develop management and leadership skills while furthering their engineering education at the graduate level. EMGT students take core courses in organizational behavior, project management, systems engineering, finance, and marketing, augmented by additional courses in management and leadership. In parallel, students design a Technical Stem program to advance their knowledge in an advanced engineering discipline and round out their education with an Enrichment Experience. The combination of business and graduate-level engineering coursework prepares students for leadership roles in technologically sophisticated companies.</p>
<h2 id="master-of-science-program-requirements">Master Of Science Program Requirements</h2>
<p>Admission to the Engineering Management and Leadership Program is open to those students who hold an undergraduate or graduate degree in engineering, mathematics, computer science, or engineering physics. The undergraduate degree must be from a four-year engineering program substantially equivalent to Santa Clara University&#x2019;s. Students holding undergraduate degrees other than bioengineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering must be prepared to select technical stem courses from these disciplines as listed in the Graduate Engineering Bulletin. In addition, the GRE is required for all students who do not have at least two years of working experience in the United States.</p>

<p>Courses for the Technical Stem of Engineering Management and Leadership are selected from the graduate course listings in the Graduate Bulletin. However, not all graduate classes listed in the bulletin are considered technical in terms of fulfilling the technical stem requirements. This is especially the case of ENGR courses. In addition, there are other limitations, some of which are listed below. Therefore, it is important that students complete a program of studies in their first term, to make sure all of the courses they select will fulfill the degree requirements.</p>
<p>&#x2022; All courses applied to the Engineering Management and Leadership degree must be graded courses&#x2014;no P/NP courses are allowed.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Undergraduate courses cross-listed with graduate course numbers do not apply unless the student registers with the graduate course number.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Graduate seminars in other departments such as ELEN 200, COEN 400, MECH 261, MECH 297 are not applicable.</p>
<p>&#x2022; COEN 485 Software Engineering Capstone is not applicable to the technical stem unless students complete three one-quarter consecutive sessions beginning in the fall quarter.</p>
<p>&#x2022; BIOE 210, COEN 288, and ENGR 245, 261, 271, 272, 273, 288, 289, 293, 302, 303, 304, 306, 330, 332, 334, 336, 338, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 349, and 350 do not count toward the technical stem. </p>
<p>&#x2022; Engineering Management and Leadership students are allowed to enroll in one unit of Independent Study or Directed Research under the direction of a full-time faculty member in the respective engineering department. Any additional units will not be counted toward graduation.</p>
<p>&#x2022; New courses are often developed and offered during the academic year that are not listed in this bulletin. It is important that students check with their advisor prior to enrolling in those courses to make sure they will count toward their degree.</p>
<p>All of the requirements for the engineering management and leadership degree must be completed within a six-year timeframe. In addition to the overall 3.0 GPA graduation requirement, engineering management and leadership degree candidates must earn a 3.0 GPA in those courses applied to their technical stem and a 3.0 GPA in their engineering management course stem. All courses in which a student is enrolled at Santa Clara are included in these calculations. </p>
<p>A completed program of studies for Engineering Management and Leadership degree candidates must be submitted to the chair of the Department of Engineering Management and Leadership during the first term of enrollment to ensure that all courses undertaken are applicable to the degree. Students who take courses that have not been approved for their program of studies by both the department chair and the Graduate Programs Office do so at their own risk, as they may not be counted toward completion of the degree.</p>
<p>A maximum of nine quarter units (six semester units) of graduate-level coursework may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student&#x2019;s advisor provided they have not been applied to a previous degree. However, in no case will the minimum units taken in the Department of Engineering Management and Leadership be fewer than 16. Extension classes, continuing education classes, professional development courses, or classes from international universities are not accepted for transfer credits. </p>

<h4 id="emgt-388-system-supportability-and-logistics">EMGT 388. System Supportability and Logistics</h4>
<p>The supportability of a system can be defined as the ability of a system to be supported in a cost-effective and timely manner, with a minimum of logistics support resources. The required resources might include test and support equipment, trained maintenance personnel, spare and repair parts, technical documentation, and special facilities. For large complex systems, supportability considerations may be significant and often have a major impact upon lifecycle cost. It is therefore particularly important that these considerations be included early during the system design trade studies and design decision-making.<br>(2 units)</p>
<h4 id="emgt-389-design-for-reliability-maintainability-and-supportability">EMGT 389. Design for Reliability, Maintainability, and Supportability</h4>
<p>Provides the tools and techniques that can be used early in the design phase to effectively influence the design from the perspective of system reliability, maintainability, and supportability. Students will be introduced to various requirements, definition and analysis tools and techniques to include Quality Function Deployment, Input-Output Matrices, and Parameter Taxonomy.<br>(2 units)</p>
<h4 id="emgt-390-system-architecture-and-design">EMGT 390. System Architecture and Design</h4>
