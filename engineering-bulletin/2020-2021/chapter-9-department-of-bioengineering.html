<h4 id="bioe-378-advanced-biomaterials">BIOE 378. Advanced Biomaterials</h4>
<p>The objective of this course is to examine the range of new biomaterials potentially applicable to medical and biotechnology devices. The content will focus on chemistry and fabrication of polymeric biomaterials, surface properties, nano-scale analytical tools, effects of the biological environment and interaction with cells and tissues. In teams of 2 to 4, students will prepare and orally present a design study for a solution to a medical problem requiring one or more biomaterials, using tissue engineering and regenerative approaches. Students should be familiar with or prepared to learn medical, anatomical and physiological terminology. Written assignments are an annotated bibliography drawn from research literature on the topic of the design study and an individually-written section of the team&#x2019;s report. Material from lectures and student presentations will be covered in short quizzes and a final examination.<br>(2 units)</p>
<h4 id="bioe-357-root-cause-analysis-rca-effective-problem-solving">BIOE 357. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Effective Problem Solving</h4>
<p>Solving problems is one of the main functions of engineering and one of the main concerns of engineering managers. This course will focus on a step by step problem solving approach, used by the best engineering practitioners in the world, designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the problem-solving process. Topics will include proper methods of problem description, identification, correction, and containment. Also listed as EMGT 357.<br>(2 units)</p>
<h4 id="bioe-380-clinical-trials-design-analysis-and-ethical-issues">BIOE 380. Clinical Trials: Design, Analysis, and Ethical Issues</h4>
<p>This course will cover the principles behind the logistics of design and analysis of clinical trials from the statistical and ethical perspectives. Topics include methods used for quantification of treatment effect(s) and associated bias interpretation, cross-over designs used in randomized clinical trials and clinical equipoise. Also listed as BIOE 180. Prerequisites: BIOE 10, BIOE 120 or AMTH 108, or instructor approval. (4 units)</p>
