<p>The undergraduate programs leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering were first offered at Santa Clara University in 1912 and these programs were later accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology in 1937. Since that time, the following degree programs have been added: Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, General Engineering, and Web Design and Engineering; Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Engineering Management and Leadership, Mechanical Engineering, Software Engineering and Power Systems and Sustainable Energy; Engineer&#x2019;s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering; and Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. In addition, the School of Engineering offers a variety of certificate programs, as well as an Open University program.</p>
