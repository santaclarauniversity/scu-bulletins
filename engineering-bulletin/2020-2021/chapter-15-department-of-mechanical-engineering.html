<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering is dedicated to delivering up-to-date, high-quality courses across a broad range of the discipline to meet the needs of both part- and full-time graduate students. These courses are concentrated in six technical areas: (1) design and analysis of thermo-fluid systems; (2) analysis and control of dynamic systems; (3) robotics and mechatronic systems; (4) mechanical design; (5) materials engineering; and (6) theoretical and computational mechanics. Educational efforts are channeled to expand the skills of prospective and practicing engineers, not only in understanding fundamentals but also in developing competence in analyzing engineering systems. The department offers graduate degrees at the master, engineer, and doctorate levels, as well as certificates.</p>
<h2 id="master-of-science-programs">Master Of Science Programs</h2>
<p>An M.S. degree requires 46 units of study with an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher. The student must select one of the five concentration areas and develop a program of studies with an advisor. Courses taken to satisfy any particular requirement may be used to simultaneously satisfy additional requirements for which they are appropriate. Master of Science degrees must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineering Core- Enrichment experience requirement as described in Chapter 4 (8 units)</li>
<li>Math requirement: 8 units composed of MECH 200 and 201, or MECH 202, and an approved two-course sequence or equivalent four-unit course in applied math</li>
<li>Topic Requirement: 8 or more units depending on concentration area</li>
<li>Concentration Electives: depending on the area (approximately 12 units)</li>
<li>Culminating experience: 4&#x2013;9 units toward a thesis, capstone project, or project course sequence</li>
</ul>
<p>Culminating experience options depend on the concentration area. A thesis requires a faculty advisor and must be approved by an additional reader and the department chair. Thesis topics are to be determined by the student and faculty advisor, who need not be the concentration advisor. The additional reader need not be a Mechanical Engineering faculty member, but must be a full-time faculty member in the School of Engineering.</p>
<p>The student may take any additional graduate courses offered by the School of Engineering to meet the 46-unit requirement, but no more than six units of Engineering Management courses may be taken.</p>

<h2 id="doctor-of-philosophy-program">Doctor Of Philosophy Program</h2>
<p>The Doctor of Philosophy degree is conferred by the School of Engineering in recognition of competence in the subject field and the ability to investigate engineering problems independently, resulting in a new contribution to knowledge in the field.</p>
<p>See the section on <a href="chapter-2-academic-programs-and-requirements.html">Academic Regulations</a> for details on admission and general degree requirements. The following departmental information augments the general School requirements.</p>
<h3 id="academic-advisor">Academic Advisor</h3>
<p>A temporary academic advisor will be provided to the student upon admission. The student and advisor must meet prior to registration for the second quarter to complete a preliminary program of studies, which will be determined largely by the coursework needed for the preliminary exam.</p>
<h3 id="preliminary-exam">Preliminary Exam</h3>
<p>A preliminary written exam is offered at least once per year by the School of Engineering as needed. The purpose is to ascertain the depth and breadth of the student&#x2019;s preparation and suitability for Ph.D. work. Each student in mechanical engineering must take and pass an exam in mathematics as well as in four areas from the following list: Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Strength of Materials, Dynamics, Design, Controls, Vibrations, Finite Element Analysis, Material Science, and Thermodynamics. The advisor must approve the student&#x2019;s petition to take the exam. This exam should be taken within one year of starting the program.</p>
<h3 id="doctoral-committee">Doctoral Committee</h3>
<p>After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of which must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student&#x2019;s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student&#x2019;s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student&#x2019;s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student&#x2019;s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members.</p>
<h3 id="time-limit-for-completing-degree">Time Limit for Completing Degree</h3>
<p>All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. This includes leave of absence/withdraws. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student&#x2019;s doctoral committee and approved by the dean of engineering in consultation with the Research Program Leadership Council.</p>
<h2 id="engineers-degree-program">Engineer&#x2019;s Degree Program</h2>
