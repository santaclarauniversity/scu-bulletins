<h3 id="bsms-5-year-program">B.S./M.S. 5 Year Program</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automatic admission into the five-year program is based on a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the major. Upon notification of acceptance into the B.S./M.S. program, students may begin taking graduate-level courses in their senior year and a maximum of 20 units can be transferred into the graduate program.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="open-university">Open University</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering will not be accepting applications for Open University.</li>
<li>For those who want to update their skills and learn new technologies without the commitment of earning a graduate degree, Open University allows students to enroll in graduate-level classes. </li>
<li>If students wish to apply to a degree program at a later date, they must follow the same procedure and submit the same supporting documentation required of degree-seeking applicants. A maximum of 16 units may apply toward the degree if the courses are in the same discipline to which the student is accepted. The general GRE test requirement for admission to the master&#x2019;s degree program will be waived if the student has completed a set of required courses in the department to which they are applying and has earned a GPA of 3.5 or higher. A list of these courses can be found on the Graduate Engineering website:<a href="http://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/waiving-the-gre/" target="_blank"> www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/waiving-the-gre/</a></li>
