<p><em>Program Advisor:</em> Dr. Christopher Kitts</p>
<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>Robotics and the automation sciences relating to intelligent machines and smart systems is a burgeoning field that is fueling the economy, driving employment in Silicon Valley and beyond, and transforming the nature of work in a wide range of applications. We offer a multi-disciplinary master&#x2019;s degree in Robotics and Automation, which balances deep technical expertise with practical application-oriented experience and with insight into the societal impacts, ethical challenges and entrepreneurial opportunities relevant to this field. A technical core ensures competence in the areas of design, controls and perception. Elective-based focus areas within the degree provide opportunities for students to build knowledge and expertise in application areas such as industrial internet-of-things and manufacturing, field robotics, etc. Furthermore, partnerships with local companies and agencies provide highly applicable project experiences, ensure a relevant curriculum, and contribute to a strong student recruitment pipeline. Finally, a novel co-curricular option certifies student competencies in modern skills and tools relevant to the robotics and automation industry.</p>
<p><strong>MASTER&#x2019;S DEGREE PROGRAM AND REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>Students interested in this major must satisfy the standard admissions criteria used by the School of Engineering, which include an undergraduate degree in a field of engineering or related area, appropriate GRE scores, and demonstrated proficiency in English. Students must also have an academic background or be able to demonstrate proficiency in computer programming, electrical circuit design, and mechanical design; students deficient in one or more of these areas may be required to take additional courses in these areas at either the graduate or undergraduate level prior to entering or early in their degree program. Students are expected to maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.0 while enrolled in the program. They must also develop a Robotics and Automation Program of Studies with an academic advisor and file this document with the Graduate Services Office by the end of their first quarter at SCU.</p>
<p>The degree requires completion of a minimum of 46 graduate units, to include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enrichment Experience (minimum 8 units)</strong><ul>

<p>Students are encouraged to complete collections of these electives to meet technology themes within the field of robotics and automation. These collections may evolve over time given technology trends; the program web site lists current themes with affiliated industry partners and capstone/thesis opportunities. Examples include topics such as advanced manufacturing, field robotics, bio-robotics/mechatronics, aerospace robotics, automation sciences, and so on.</p>
<p>Culminating Experience (6-12 units): Students must complete 6-9 units of either a Capstone Design Project or a 9-12 unit Thesis research project through an existing Capstone or Masters Thesis course in a relevant engineering department.</p>
<p>Additional Units (as necessary): Additional units as required to reach a minimum of 46 units must be completed; these must be approved by the student&#x2019;s advisor via the Program of Studies prior to enrolling in the courses. Typically, any extra units would be completed by enrolling in additional technical elective courses; however, in some cases, it may be of interest to take courses such as the project management or systems engineering course sequences offered by the Engineering Management program. Students may not apply the completion of one course to two different requirement categories, with the exception of the mathematics requirement.</p>
<p>Modern Tools/Skills Competency Badging (Optional): Students may participate in this competency certification system to develop verified capabilities, acknowledged through the awarding of a &#x201C;badge,&#x201D; in a variety of areas that are in great demand by employers. Some of these badges will be obtained through completion of courses within the program. Others may be incorporated into the required &#x201C;culminating experience.&#x201D; There may also be opportunities to participate in co-curricular non-credit workshops in some topics. Management of these competency badges are managed through an online design portfolio system available to all students.</p>
