<h3 id="certificate-in-frugal-innovation"><strong>Certificate in Frugal Innovation</strong></h3>
<p> <em>Advisor:</em> Dr. Aleksandar Zecevic</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, global trends have been forcing businesses to adapt to growing consumer bases in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which are in desperate need of low-cost and high-quality solutions to the challenges that they face. The importance of these new &#x201C;economic realities&#x201D; is underscored by the fact that emerging markets are expected to exceed 50% of the world&#x2019;s GDP in 2017 (according to IMF estimates). In order to excel professionally in such an environment, engineers will have to be equipped with the knowledge and skill sets to appropriately define, design, and implement solutions that are not merely a &#x201C;stripping down&#x201D; of Western products to meet the rising demand. Industry, particularly in Silicon Valley, is becoming increasingly aware of this fact and has begun to move toward a &#x2018;Triple Bottom Line&#x2019; approach to business, which integrates environmental, societal, and financial considerations. The Certificate in Frugal Innovation is designed to give students the ability and the tools to adapt to this new model, and to expand their understanding of the impact that engineering has on society.</p>
<p>This program is suitable for working professionals in a wide variety of engineering disciplines. To enroll, students must have a B.S in Engineering from an accredited institution, and should maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 in order to receive the certificate.</p>
<p><strong>Program Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The Certificate in Frugal Innovation entails a minimum of 16 units of course work. It consists of an eight-unit Core, and a set of electives that are organized into two groups. Students are required to take four units from Group A and another four from Group B, as described below.</p>
