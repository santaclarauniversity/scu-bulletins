Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California&apos;s oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, law, engineering, education, counseling psychology, pastoral ministries, and theology. The University boasts a diverse community of scholars offering a values-oriented curriculum characterized by small class sizes and a dedication to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education--educating the whole person for a life of service--run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs.</p>
<p>The University was established as Santa Clara College on the site of the Mission Santa Clara de As&#xED;s, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally operated as a preparatory school and did not offer collegiate courses until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. One-third of the students were enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college&#x2019;s preparatory and high school departments.</p>
<p>Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added. In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business opened in 1926, and within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the country to receive national accreditation.</p>
<p>For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admissions explosion&#x2014;from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began the largest building program in school history, building eight residence halls, a student union, and an athletic stadium. In 1985, the University adopted &#x201C;Santa Clara University&#x201D; as its official name.</p>
<p><strong>University Vision, Mission And Fundamental Values</strong></p>
<p>Santa Clara University has adopted three directional statements to describe the kind of university it aspires to become (Strategic Vision), its core purpose and the constituencies it serves (University Mission), and the beliefs that guide its actions (Fundamental Values).</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Vision</strong></p>
<p>Santa Clara University will educate citizens and leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion, and cultivate knowledge and faith to build a more humane, just, and sustainable world.</p>
<p><strong>University Mission</strong></p>
<p>The University pursues its vision by creating an academic community that educates the whole person within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition, making student learning our central focus, continuously improving our curriculum and co-curriculum, strengthening our scholarship and creative work, and serving the communities of which we are a part in Silicon Valley and around the world.</p>
<p>Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educational environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world.</p>
<p>As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institutional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society.</p>
<p>We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to the<br>development of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily residential setting</li>
<li>Graduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contributions to their fields</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for non-matriculated students.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamental Values</strong></p>
<p>The University is committed to these core values, which guide us in carrying out our mission and realizing our vision:</p>
<p><em><strong>Academic Excellence.</strong></em> We seek an uncompromising standard of excellence in teaching, learning, creativity, and scholarship within and across disciplines.</p>
<p><em><strong>Search for Truth, Goodness, and Beauty.</strong></em> We prize scholarship and creative work that advance human understanding, improve teaching and learning, and add to the betterment of society by illuminating the most significant problems of the day and exploring the enduring mysteries of life. In this search, our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering.</p>
<p><em><strong>Engaged Learning.</strong></em> We strive to integrate academic reflection and direct experience in the classroom and the community, especially to understand and improve the lives of those with the least education, power, and wealth.</p>
<p><em><strong>Commitment to Students.</strong></em> As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, we endeavor to educate the whole person. We nurture and challenge students--intellectually, spiritually, aesthetically, morally, socially, and physically&#x2013;-preparing them for leadership and service to the common good in their professional, civic, and personal lives.</p>
<p><em><strong>Service to Others.</strong></em> We promote throughout the University a culture of service&#x2014;service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its most disadvantaged members as we work with and for others to build a more humane, just, faith-filled, and sustainable world.</p>
<p><em><strong>Community and Diversity.</strong></em> We cherish our diverse and inclusive community of students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni, a community that is enriched by people of different backgrounds, respectful of the dignity of all its members, enlivened by open communication, and caring and just toward others.</p>
<p><em><strong>Jesuit Distinctiveness.</strong></em> We treasure our Jesuit heritage and tradition, which incorporates all of these core values. This tradition gives expression to our Jesuit educational mission and Catholic identity while also welcoming and respecting other religious and philosophical traditions, promoting the dialogue between faith and culture, and valuing opportunities to deepen religious beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>Alumni</strong></p>
<p>Santa Clara University has over 100,000alumni living around the world--in all 50 states and more than 100 countries. More than half of the alumni live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many are leaders in business, law, engineering, academia, and public service. These graduates connect with one another and the current campus community by engaging with over 45 different groups organized around identity, industry, and location.</p>
<p><strong>Campus</strong></p>
<p>The University is located on a 106-acre campus in the city of Santa Clara near the southern end of the San Francisco Bay in one of the world&#x2019;s great cultural centers. More than 50 buildings on campus house 15 student residences, a main library, a law library, two student centers, the de Saisset Museum, extensive performing arts and athletic facilities, and a recreation and fitness center.</p>
<p>Santa Clara&#x2019;s campus has the advantage of being located in Silicon Valley&#x2014;a region known for its extraordinary visionaries, who have designed and created some of the most significant scientific and technological advances of our age. Silicon Valley is more than a location&#x2014;it is a mindset and home to more than 3million residents and 6,600 science- and technology-related companies, (not including San Francisco, which is located just an hour away).</p>
<p>Santa Clara&#x2019;s campus is well known for its beauty and Mission-style architecture. Opened in 2013, the brick-paved Abby Sobrato Mall leads visitors from the University&#x2019;s main entrance to the heart of campus&#x2014;the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/missionchurch/" target="_blank">Mission Santa Clara de As&#xED;s</a>. The rose gardens and palm and olive trees of the <a href="https://university-operations.scu.edu/facilities/space-data/grounds-information/mission-gardens/" target="_blank">Mission Gardens</a> surround the historic Mission Church, which was restored in 1928. The adjacent <a href="https://www.scu.edu/auxiliary-services/adobe-lodge/" target="_blank">Adobe Lodge</a> is the oldest building on campus. In 1981, it was restored to its 1822 decor.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Facilities</strong></p>
<p>Amid all this beauty and history are modern, world-class academic facilities. Students study and thrive in places such as the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/is/lctcl/" target="_blank">Joanne E. Harrington Learning Commons, Sobrato Family Technology Center and Orradre Library</a> where individuals and groups can study in an inviting, light-filled, and open environment. Notably, the library features an Automated Retrieval System, a high-density storage area where up to 900,000 books and other publications can be stored and retrieved using robotic-assisted technology.</p>
<p>Another example of Santa Clara&#x2019;s excellent academic facilities is Lucas Hall, home of the Leavey School of Business. This modern 85,000-square-foot building houses classrooms, meeting rooms, offices, study spaces, and a caf&#xE9;. Classrooms are equipped with state-of-the-art videoconferencing equipment as well as a multiplatform system to record faculty lectures for later review by students. Vari Hall (formerly Arts and Sciences) adjacent to Lucas Hall is home to the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics as well as academic departments, classrooms, and a 2,200-square-foot digital television studio&#x2014;among the best found on any campus nationwide.</p>

Opened in 2012, the lobby of this LEED Gold equivalent structure includes technology-infused exhibits that illustrate Santa Clara&#x2019;s Jesuit mission. Among other green features on campus are two solar-powered houses built in 2007 and 2009 for the U.S. Department of Energy&#x2019;s Solar Decathlon. Both homes now serve as laboratories for solar and sustainability technologies.</p>
<p><strong>University Library &amp; Learning Commons</strong></p>
<p>The Santa Clara University Library &amp; Learning Commons is a central hub for students to study and collaborate. The Learning Commons has a mix of both individual and group seating, group study rooms, computer labs, outside patios, as well as a cafe on the first floor. Throughout the year, the University Library hosts events, art exhibits, and late-night hours. Library staff are available to support student research. You can contact library staff in person at the Library Help Desk, by making an appointment online, or through our 24/7 chat service, &quot;Ask a Librarian.&quot; The Library&apos;s Archives &amp; Special Collections provides access to rare books, manuscripts, historic photos, and artifacts.</p>
<p>Library resources, which can be accessed within the Learning Commons and remotely, include an online catalog (OSCAR), over 250 general and subject-specific databases, research guides for many subjects and classes, and interlibrary loan programs. The library&apos;s collection includes books, ebooks, magazines, newspapers and journals, streaming videos, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Schott Admission and Enrollment Services Building</strong></p>
<p>Located near Vari Hall is the Schott Admission and Enrollment Services Building, a welcome center for campus visitors and home to several University departments. Opened in 2012, the lobby of this LEED Gold equivalent structure includes technology-infused exhibits that illustrate Santa Clara&apos;s Jesuit mission.</p>
<p>Among other green features on campus are two solar-powered homes built in 2007 and 2009 for the U.S. Department of Energy&apos;s Solar Decathlon. Both homes now serve as laboratories for solar and sustainability technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Sobrato Campus for Discovery and Innovation</strong></p>
<p>This new 270,000 square-foot building is the home to the School of Engineering and many of the science departments of the College of Arts and Sciences. The building has classrooms, Innovation Zone, teaching and research labs, engineering and science shops, faculty and staff offices, collaboration spaces, and cafe.

<p><strong>Student Life</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.scu.edu/benson/" target="_blank">Robert F. Benson Memorial Center</a> serves as a hub for campus life. The Benson Memorial Center offers dining services and houses the campus bookstore, student and administrative offices, lounges,and meeting rooms. The University&#x2019;s main dining hall, The Marketplace, resembles an upscale food court with numerous stations and options. For a more informal experience, The Bronco is the Benson Center&#x2019;s late-night venue, serving beverages and pub-style food.</p>
<p>Another hotspot for student life, the Paul L. Locatelli, S.J., Student Activity Center includes a 6,000-square-foot gathering hall with a high ceiling that can accommodate dances and concerts as well as pre- and post-game activities. Designed with environmental sensitivity, the building is energy efficient and has daytime lighting controls and motion sensors to maximize use of natural light.

<p>The campus features many locations for quiet reflection as well, such as the St. Clare Garden, which features plants and flowers arranged into five groups to portray the stages of the saint&#x2019;s life. For campus members who want a more hands-on relationship with nature, the Forge Garden, SCU&#x2019;s half-acre organic garden, serves as a campus space for course research, service learning, and sustainable food production.</p>
<p><strong>Athletics And The Arts</strong></p>
<p>The importance of athletics to the University is evident everywhere on campus. Among the newest additions to Santa Clara&apos;s athletics facilities are the Stephen Schott Stadium, home field for the men&apos;s baseball team, and the state-of-the-art Stevens Soccer Training Center, funded by a gift from Mary and Mark Stevens. The gift also allowed Santa Clara to upgrade the stands in Stevens Stadium (formerly Buck Shaw Stadium), home to the men&apos;s and women&apos;s soccer programs, and build a plaza to celebrate Bronco sports---its past, present, and future. The plaza celebrates the history of Santa Clara University football as well as the legacy and future of men&apos;s and women&apos;s soccer at SCU. Bellomy Field, eight acres of well-lit and grassy playing fields, provides space for club and intramural sports, such as rugby and field hockey. Adjacent to Bellomy Field is the well-appointed women&apos;s softball field, which opened in 2013. The Leavey Event Center houses the University&apos;s premier basketball facility. Over the years, the Leavey Event Center has hosted nine West Coast Conference Basketball Championships.</p>
<p>The University recognizes the arts as an important part of life at Santa Clara University. The Edward M. Dowd Art and Art History Building opened in 2016, housing an integrated fine arts program that is a destination and a center for inspiration, innovation, and engagement in the arts and art history in Silicon Valley. An important arts destination in the Bay Area, the Department of Art and Art History\s gallery exhibits artwork from a diverse group of established and emerging artists, and provides a dynamic teaching and learning resource for faculty, staff, students and the community.The de Saisset Museum, the University&apos;s accredited museum of art and history, presents changing art exhibitions throughout the year and serves as the caretaker of the University&apos;s California History Collection, which includes artifacts from the Native American, Mission, and early Santa Clara College periods.</p>
<p>SCU&#x2022;Presents represents the University&apos;s commitment to the performing arts on campus, which includes performances at venues such as the Louis B. Mayer Theatre, the Fess Parker Studio Theatre, and the Music Recital Hall. The Mayer Theatre is Santa Clara University&apos;s premier theatrical venue, housing 500 intimate seats in either a flexible proscenium or thrust-stage setting. The Fess Parker Studio Theatre has no fixed stage or seating. Its black box design, complete with movable catwalks, provides flexibility in an experimental setting. The 250-seat Music Recital Hall provides a contemporary setting where students, faculty, and guest artists offer a variety of performances.</p>
