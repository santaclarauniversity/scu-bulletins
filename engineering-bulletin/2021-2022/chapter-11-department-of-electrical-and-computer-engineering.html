<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>The field of electrical and computer engineering covers the design, construction, testing, and operation of electrical components, circuits, and systems. Electrical and computer engineers work with information representation, processing and transmission; advancing integrated circuit design for digital, analog, and mixed signals systems; designing and characterizing antennas, RF, microwave and millimeter-wave Systems; new devices and architectures, energy systems and renewable energy; nanotechnology; and all the areas of information circuits and systems that have traditionally supported these efforts. This includes all phases of the digital or analog transmission of information, such as in mobile communications and networks, radio, television, telephone systems, fiber optics, and satellite communications, as well as control and robotics, electric power, information processing and storage.</p>
<p>The Electrical and Computer Engineering Programs are supported by the facilities of the University&#x2019;s Academic Computing Center, as well as by the Engineering Computing Center. The department supports 10 major teaching and research laboratories, five additional laboratories used only for teaching, and a laboratory dedicated to the support of design projects. The five teaching laboratories cover the fields of digital systems, electric circuits, electronics, systems, and RF and communication.</p>
<p><strong>Master&#x2019;s Degree Program And Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The master&#x2019;s degree will be granted to degree candidates who complete a program of studies approved by a faculty advisor. The degree does not require a thesis, but students may include a thesis in their program with up to nine units for their thesis work. The program must consist of no less than 46 units. In addition, a 3.0 cumulative GPA (B average) must be earned in all coursework taken at Santa Clara University. Residence requirements are met by completing no less than 37 units of the graduate program at Santa Clara University. A maximum of nine quarter units (six-semester units) of graduate-level coursework may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student&#x2019;s advisor. All units applied toward the degree, including those transferred from other institutions, must be earned within six years from initial enrollment.</p>
<p>Students must develop a program of studies with an academic advisor and file the approved program during their first term of enrollment at Santa Clara University. The program of studies must contain a minimum of 46 units of graduate-level engineering courses which include at least 27 units of courses offered within the electrical and computer department and no more than four units of engineering management courses.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Electrical and Computer Engineering breadth: (minimum 4 units) Two other focus areas must be selected as breadth areas. For each breadth area, one course must be taken from the list of required courses for that area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additional graduate courses recommended and approved by the graduate program advisor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These M.S. degree requirements may be adjusted by the advisor based on the student&#x2019;s previous graduate work.</p>
<p>An advisor may approve selected undergraduate classes that do not duplicate course content of graduate courses in the program of studies. No more than 15 units of electives may be selected from the following upper-division undergraduate courses: 105, 112, 116, 117, 118, 130, 133, 141, 144, 151, 152, 156, 160, 164, 183 and 184.</p>
<p>Alterations in the approved program, consistent with the above departmental requirements, may be requested at any time by a petition initiated by the student and approved by the advisor.</p>
<p>Students with relevant technical backgrounds may be admitted to the master&#x2019;s program without an undergraduate degree in electrical or electrical and computer engineering from an accredited program. In order to guarantee prerequisites for graduate courses, those students must take sufficient additional courses beyond the 46-unit minimum to ensure coverage of all areas of the undergraduate EE core requirements. A student who has earned a Fundamentals of Electrical and Computer Engineering Certificate will have satisfied these background requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Undergraduate Core Courses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ELEN 21 Introduction to Logic Design</li>
<li>ELEN 50 Electric Circuits I</li>
<li>ELEN 100 Electric Circuits II</li>
<li>ELEN 115 Electronic Circuits I</li>
<li>ELEN 120 Microprocessor System Design</li>
</ul>
<p>The advisor will determine which courses must be taken to meet these requirements. Undergraduate core courses will not be included in the 46 units required for the master&#x2019;s degree.</p>
<p><em>Please Note: In general, no credit will be allowed for courses that duplicate prior coursework, including courses listed above as degree requirements. (However, graduate-level treatment of a topic is more advanced than an undergraduate course with a similar title.) Students should discuss any adjustments of these requirements with their academic advisor before filing their program of studies. In all cases, prerequisite requirements should be interpreted to mean the course specified or an equivalent course taken elsewhere.</em></p>
<p><strong>Engineer&#x2019;s Degree Program And Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The program leading to the Engineer&#x2019;s Degree is particularly designed for the education of the practicing engineer. The degree is granted on completion of an approved academic program and a record of acceptable technical achievement in the candidate&#x2019;s field of engineering. The academic program consists of a minimum of 46 quarter units beyond the master&#x2019;s degree. Courses are selected to advance competence in specific areas relating to the engineering professional&#x2019;s work. Evidence of technical achievement must include a paper principally written by the candidate and accepted for publication by a recognized engineering journal prior to the granting of the degree. A letter from the journal accepting the paper must be submitted to the department chair. In certain cases, the department may accept publication in the peer-reviewed proceedings of an appropriate national or international conference.</p>
<p>Electrical and Computer Engineering courses at the introductory Master of Science level (e.g., ELEN 210, 211, 212, 230, 231, 236, 241, 250, 261; and AMTH 210, 211, 220, 221, 230, 231, 235, 236, 240, 245, 246) are not generally acceptable in an Engineer&#x2019;s Degree program of studies. However, with the approval of the advisor, the student may include up to three of these courses in the Engineer&#x2019;s Degree program. The department also requires that at least 15 units of the program of studies be in topics other than the student&#x2019;s major field of concentration. Candidates admitted to the Electrical and Computer Engineering Program who have M.S. degrees in fields other than electrical and computer engineering must include in their graduate programs (M.S. and Engineer&#x2019;s Degree combined) a total of at least 46 units of graduate-level electrical and computer engineering coursework approved by an academic advisor.</p>
<p><strong>Ph.D. Program And Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is conferred by the School of Engineering primarily in recognition of competence in the subject field and the ability to investigate engineering problems independently, resulting in a new contribution to knowledge in the field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a thesis based on that research, publication of the research, and a program of advanced studies in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences.</p>
<p>The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Bioengineering are collaborating to offer a Ph.D. in interdisciplinary topics related to Bioengineering. Faculty from both departments will co-advise the Ph.D. students and the degree will be awarded by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</p>
<p><strong>Preliminary Examination</strong></p>
<p>The preliminary examination shall be written and shall include subject matter deemed by the major department to represent sufficient preparation in depth and breadth for advanced study in the major. Only those who pass the written examination may take any required oral preliminary examination.</p>
<p>Students currently studying at Santa Clara University for a master&#x2019;s degree who are accepted for the Ph.D. program and who are at an advanced stage of the M.S. program may, with the approval of their academic advisor, take the preliminary examination before completing the M.S. degree requirements. Students who have completed the M.S. degree requirements and have been accepted for the Ph.D. program should take the preliminary examination as soon as possible but not more than two years after beginning the program.</p>
<p>Only those students who pass the preliminary examination shall be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. The preliminary examination may be repeated only once, and then only at the discretion of the thesis advisor.</p>
<p><strong>General Requirements</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Thesis Advisor</strong></em></p>
<p>It is the student&#x2019;s responsibility to obtain consent from a full-time faculty member in the student&#x2019;s major department to serve as his/her prospective thesis advisor.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that Ph.D. students find a thesis advisor before taking the preliminary examination. After passing the preliminary examination, Ph.D. students should have a thesis advisor before the beginning of the next quarter following the preliminary examination. Students currently pursuing a master&#x2019;s degree at the time of their preliminary examination should have a thesis advisor as soon as possible after being accepted as a Ph.D. student.</p>
<p>The student and the thesis advisor jointly develop a complete program of studies for research in a particular area. The complete program of studies (and any subsequent changes) must be filed with the Graduate Programs Office and approved by the student&#x2019;s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that courses taken will be acceptable toward the Ph.D. course requirements.</p>
<p><em><strong>Doctoral Committee</strong></em></p>
<p>After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of whom must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student&#x2019;s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student&#x2019;s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student&#x2019;s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student&#x2019;s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members.</p>
<p><em><strong>Residence</strong></em></p>
<p>The doctoral degree is granted based on achievement, rather than on the accumulation of units of credit. However, the candidate is expected to complete a minimum of 72 quarter units of graduate credit beyond the master&#x2019;s degree. Of these, 36 quarter units may be earned through coursework and independent study, and 36 through the thesis. All Ph.D. thesis units are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. A maximum of 18 quarter units (12-semester units) may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student&#x2019;s advisor.</p>
<p>Ph.D. students must undertake a minimum of four consecutive quarters of full-time study at the University; spring and fall quarters are considered consecutive. The residency time shall normally be any period between passing the preliminary examination and completion of the thesis. For this requirement, full-time study is interpreted as a minimum registration of eight units per quarter during the academic year and four units during the summer session. Any variation from this requirement must be approved by the doctoral committee.</p>
<p><em><strong>Comprehensive Examinations and Admission to Candidacy</strong></em></p>
<p>After completion of the formal coursework approved by the doctoral committee, the student shall present his/her research proposal as part of a comprehensive oral examination on the coursework and the subject of his/her research work. The student should make arrangements for the comprehensive examinations through the doctoral committee. A student who passes the comprehensive examinations is considered a degree candidate. The comprehensive examinations typically must be completed within four years from the time the student is admitted to the doctoral program. Comprehensive examinations may be repeated once, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the doctoral committee.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thesis Research and Defense</strong></em></p>
<p>The period following the comprehensive examinations is devoted to research for the thesis, although such research may begin before the examinations are complete. After successfully completing the comprehensive examinations, the student must pass an oral examination on his/her research and thesis, conducted by the doctoral committee and whomever they appoint as examiners. The thesis must be made available to all examiners one month prior to the examination. The oral examination shall consist of a presentation of the results of the thesis and the defense. This examination is open to the public, but only members of the doctoral committee have a vote.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thesis and Publication</strong></em></p>
<p>At least one month before the degree is to be conferred, the candidate must submit to the Office of the Dean of Engineering two copies of the final version of the thesis describing the research in its entirety. The thesis will not be considered as accepted until approved by the doctoral committee and one or more refereed articles based on it are accepted for publication in a first-tier professional or scientific journal approved by the doctoral committee. All doctoral theses must also be archived in the University library.</p>
<p><em><strong>Time Limit for Completing Degree</strong></em></p>
<p>All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. This includes any leave of absences/withdrawals. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student&#x2019;s doctoral committee and approved by the Dean of Engineering in consultation with the Graduate Program Leadership Council. (GPLC)</p>
<p><em><strong>Additional Graduation Requirements</strong></em></p>
<p>The requirements for the doctoral degree in the School of Engineering have been made to establish the structure in which the degree may be earned. Upon written approval of the Provost, the Dean of the School of Engineering, the doctoral committee, and the chair of the major department, other degree requirements may be established. The University reserves the right to evaluate the undertakings and the accomplishments of the degree candidate in total, and award or withhold the degree as a result of its deliberations.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate Programs</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>General Information</strong></em></p>
<p>Certificate programs are designed to provide an intensive background in a narrow area at the graduate level. At roughly one-third of the units of a master&#x2019;s degree program, the certificate is designed to be completed in a much shorter period of time. These certificate programs are appropriate for students working in the industry who wish to update their skills or those interested in changing their career path. Students can only take courses that are required for the certificate. Please see <a href="chapter-18-certificate-programs.html">Chapter 18</a> for additional information. </p>
<p><em><strong>Admission</strong></em></p>
<p>To be accepted into a certificate program, the applicant must have a bachelor&#x2019;s degree and meet any additional requirements for the specific certificate. Exceptions based on work experience may be granted for the Certificate in Fundamentals of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Admitted students are responsible for ensuring that they have the prerequisites for all courses they take in the Certificate Program.</p>
<p><em><strong>Grade Requirements</strong></em></p>
<p>Students must receive a minimum grade of C in each course and have an overall GPA of 3.0 or better to earn a certificate.</p>
<p><em><strong>Continuation for a Master&#x2019;s Degree</strong></em></p>
<p>All Santa Clara University graduate courses applied to the completion of a certificate program earn graduate credit that may also be applied toward a graduate degree. Students who wish to continue for such a degree must submit a separate application and satisfy all normal admission requirements. The general GRE test requirement for graduate admission to the master&#x2019;s degree will be waived for students who complete a certificate program with a GPA of 3.5 or higher.</p>
