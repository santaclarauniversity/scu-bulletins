The focus of the educational effort is on modeling, analysis, and practical methods used to analyze, design, and construct structures and other civil engineering-related infrastructure systems. As such, many of the courses offered are beneficial to civil and construction engineers, and construction managers interested in advancing their knowledge and enhancing their technical skills.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2 id="h.h9tml43abwoe"><span class=" gdbold">Degree Program</span></h2><p><span></span></p><p><span>The Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering graduate program at Santa Clara University is designed to accommodate the needs of students interested in advanced study. An individual may pursue the degree of Master of Science (M.S.) as either a full-time or part-time student through a customized balance of coursework, design projects, and directed research. Program participants are also required to supplement their technical work with coursework on project management topics addressed in the graduate engineering core curriculum.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The structural engineering (SE) track provides students with an opportunity to effectively link theory and practice by completing a combination of analysis- and design-oriented courses. Options within the structural engineering track allow students to either complete a capstone design project or a faculty-directed research investigation. This program track is aimed at individuals looking to prepare for a career in consulting structural engineering or in structural plan review.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The general civil engineering (GCE) track has been configured to provide students with additional analytical and design coursework in several infrastructure-related areas of civil engineering. This track could potentially include work in water resources engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering, and geotechnical engineering. A capstone design or research project with a required sustainability component is available to integrate these different elements. This track is geared toward individuals preparing for a career in land development, municipal engineering, or public works.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The construction engineering and management (CEM) track is designed to prepare students with the skills and knowledge required to effectively manage time, cost, safety, quality, and sustainability requirements of construction projects. The track has some flexibility to accommodate students with interests in practical applications or research investigations. This track is designed for students with career objectives of managing building or substantial construction projects for contractors, owners, and developers.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The water and environmental engineering (WEE) track prepares students to engage in advanced engineering analysis, design, and research to solve complex issues by quantifying risks related to water supply, flooding, and contamination and designing systems to treat contamination to protect public health and the environment. This track is ideal for people interested in working on these topics with public agencies, consulting firms, nonprofits, or pursuing further graduate work.</span></p><h3 id="h.kq5ry2iaz4ie"><span class=" gdbold">Master of Science in Civil Engineering</span></h3><p><span>To be considered for admission to the graduate program in Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering, an applicant must meet the requirements outlined in Chapter 3 of the bulletin, with the following additional criteria:</span></p><p><span>Applicant’s undergraduate degree must be: </span></p><ul class="lst-kix_9jlxkirrvnjz-0 start"><li><span>A civil engineering B.S. from an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)-accredited four-year program or its equivalent, or </span></li><li><span>A B.S. in a relevant technical area for the proposed graduate track. In such cases, applicants must take sufficient additional courses beyond the 46-unit minimum to ensure coverage of prerequisite material for the required classes. For example, applicants pursuing the water/environmental track would need CENG 41, CENG 141, and CENG 143, plus any missing differential equations, physics, and chemistry prerequisites to those. These additional classes are subject to the same grade requirements as described elsewhere in the bulletin. </span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><p><span>Applicant’s undergraduate record must show:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_u2itl1lcgrse-0 start"><li><span>An overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.75 (based on a 4.0 maximum scale).</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><p><span>In very rare cases, applicants not meeting this may be admitted with a requirement to successfully complete a defined course of studies within a limited time period.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>See Chapter 5 of this bulletin for details on transferring credit for courses taken at other institutions.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Upon acceptance to the graduate program in Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering, a student will be required to select a graduate advisor (full-time faculty member) from within the Department of Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering. The student’s advisor will be responsible for approving the student’s course of study. Any changes to a student’s initial course of study must have the written approval of the student’s advisor.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>To qualify for the degree of Master of Science in Civil Engineering, the students must complete a minimum of 46 quarter units, including elective and required core courses, within the School of Engineering. Required and elective courses for structural engineering, general civil engineering, and construction management tracks are provided below. Students may elect to do a design project or research project. Students undertaking a design project would investigate applying a new technique or method in the analysis or design of a structure, system, or element, and this must be documented in a design report. Students undertaking a research project would develop a new technique, method, component, or design criteria, and this must be documented in a conference or journal publication or report. Course requirements for the SE, GCE, CEM, and WEE tracks are summarized in the following table:</span></p><p><span></span></p><table><thead><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>---</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">Structural </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Engineering Track</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">General Civil</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Engineering Track </span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">Construction Engineering</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">and Management Track</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">Water and Environmental Engineering Track</span></p></td></tr></thead><tbody></tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">Required </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Technical </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Coursework</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>CENG 205</span><span>†</span><span> (2)</span></p><p><span>CENG 206</span><span>†</span><span> (2)</span></p><p><span>CENG 222 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 233* (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 234 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 236 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 237 (4)</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">(24 units)</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>CENG 219 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 237 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 238 (4/1)</span></p><p><span>CENG 249 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 250 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 282 (3)</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">(24 units)</span></p><p><span></span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>CENG 218 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 219 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 247 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 281 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 282 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 284 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 285 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 286 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 287 (3)</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">(24 units)</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">At least 15 units from:</span></p><p><span>CENG 242 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 249 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 253 (3/1)</span></p><p><span>CENG 254 (3/1)</span></p><p><span>CENG 258 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 259 (3)</span></p><p><span></span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">Elective </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Technical </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Coursework</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">6 units from:</span></p><p><span>CENG 207 (2)</span></p><p><span>CENG 218 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 220 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 231 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 232 (2)</span></p><p><span>CENG 238 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 239 (2)</span></p><p><span>CENG 240 (2)</span></p><p><span>CENG 241 (2)</span></p><p><span>CENG 244 (2)</span></p><p><span>CENG 246 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 247 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 293</span></p><p><span>CENG 295</span></p><p><span>CENG 297</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">6 units from:</span></p><p><span>CENG 218 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 242 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 247 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 251 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 253 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 254 (3/1)</span></p><p><span>CENG 256 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 258 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 259 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 261 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 262 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 263 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 293</span></p><p><span>CENG 295</span></p><p><span>CENG 297</span></p><p><span></span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">6 units from:</span></p><p><span>CENG 249 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 256 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 288 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 293</span></p><p><span>CENG 295</span></p><p><span>CENG 297</span></p><p><span>EMGT 253 (2)</span></p><p><span>EMGT 255 (2)</span></p><p><span>EMGT 292 (2)</span></p><p><span>EMGT 357 (2)</span></p><p><span>EMGT 380 (2)</span></p><p><span>EMGT 395 (2)</span></p><p><span>ENGR/GREN  357^ (2)</span></p><p><span></span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">At least 16 units from: </span><span>**</span></p><p><span>CENG 219 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 252 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 260 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 261 (4)</span></p><p><span>CENG 262 (3)</span></p><p><span>CENG 297 (3)</span></p><p><span>MECH 266 (2)</span></p><p><span>MECH 268 (2)</span></p><p><span>ENVS 117 (5)</span></p><p><span>ENVS 122 (5)</span></p><p><span>ENVS 145 (5)</span></p><p><span>ENVS 166 (5)</span></p><p><span>ENVS 185 (5)</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">Applied </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Mathematics</span></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span class=" gdbold">4 units from:</span></p><p><span>AMTH 210 (2) &amp;
