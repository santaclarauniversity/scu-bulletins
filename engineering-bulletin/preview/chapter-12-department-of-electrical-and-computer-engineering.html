The department supports 10 major teaching and research laboratories, five additional laboratories used only for teaching, and a laboratory dedicated to the support of design projects. The five teaching laboratories cover the fields of digital systems, electric circuits, electronics, systems, and RF and communication and signal processing and control systems, logic design and digital systems, In addition, the program has a laboratory dedicated to senior design projects.</span></p><p><span>Programs are offered which lead to a Master’s Degree, a Ph.D. degree, an Engineer’s Degree, or a Certificate. Each is described below. </span></p><h2 id="h.vad02rq6ztzy"><span class=" gdbold">Master’s Degree Program</span></h2><p><span>The master’s degree will be granted to degree candidates who complete a program of studies approved by a faculty advisor. The program must consist of a minimum of  46 units, and a 3.000 cumulative GPA (B average) must be earned in all coursework taken at Santa Clara University. Residence requirements are met by completing no less than 37 units of the graduate program at Santa Clara University. A maximum of nine quarter units (six-semester units) of graduate-level coursework may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor. All units applied toward the degree, including those transferred from other institutions, must be earned within six years from initial enrollment. </span><span>The program may include a thesis or a research component of smaller scope that does not require a thesis.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The program requires that students select one of these defined focus areas within electrical and computer engineering.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Power Systems and Control</span></p><p><span>Autonomous cars, space shuttles, robots, IoT and airplanes all have sophisticated control strategies. The electric utility industry is probably the largest and most complex industry in the world. How this network operates, and how it can be controlled, and how to integrate renewable energies into the grid in order to have cleaner and more sustainable energy are major challenges.</span><span> </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Faculty Advisors: Maryam Khanbaghi, Aleksandar Zecevic, </span><span>Alex Stankovic, Burak Kurkcu</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">IC Design and Technology</span></p><p><span>The study of integrated circuits (IC) (generally known as semiconductors or chips) consists of three interconnected areas of pedagogy, Circuit Design, Device Physics, and Fabrication Process Technology. One cannot imagine the world now and in the future without chips, which are in your home, in your workplace, in your automobile, and in all your electronic devices. With worldwide chips revenue projected to approach $1 trillion by 2030, the semiconductor industry, not unlike its energy counterpart, supplies the critical goods and services that sustain and advance human civilization.</span></p><p><span>Faculty Advisors: Shoba Krishnan, Cary Yang, Mahmudur Rahman</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">RF and Applied Electromagnetics</span></p><p><span>From 5G and the internet of things to automotive radar, high frequency and wireless systems are pervasive in nearly every aspect of modern technology.

In all cases, prerequisite requirements should be interpreted to mean the course specified or an equivalent course taken elsewhere.</div></span></p><h2 id="h.bv4cbt5zyrya"><span class=" gdbold">Master’s Thesis Research</span></h2><p><span>Master’s thesis research consists of a minimum of 7 units and a maximum of 15 units, which are included in “Additional Elective Courses” in the Master’s Program of Study. The first stage of the research is 6 units of Directed Research, ECEN 299. Students with an average grade of B+ or higher may continue to stage 2, which is advanced research and thesis composition. This stage requires 1 to 9 units of ECEN 297 and the submission of the completed thesis to the University library.</span></p><h2 id="h.h00p1ov8opae"><span class=" gdbold">Ph.D. Program and Requirements</span></h2><p><span>The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is conferred by the School of Engineering primarily in recognition of competence in the subject field and the ability to investigate engineering problems independently, resulting in a new contribution to knowledge in the field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a thesis based on that research, publication of the research, and a program of advanced studies in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences.</span></p><h3 id="h.2hguqfz6pzp0"><span class=" gdbold">Preliminary Examination</span></h3><p><span>The preliminary examination shall be written and shall include subject matter deemed by the major department to represent sufficient preparation in depth and breadth for advanced study in the major. Only those who pass the written examination may proceed to the subsequent Research Aptitude and Comprehensive examination.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Students currently studying at Santa Clara University for a master’s degree who are accepted for the Ph.D. program and who are at an advanced stage of the M.S. program may, with the approval of their academic advisor, take the preliminary examination before completing the M.S. degree requirements. Students who have completed the M.S. degree requirements and have been accepted for the Ph.D. program should take the preliminary examination as soon as possible but not more than two years after beginning the program.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Only those students who pass the preliminary examination shall be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. The preliminary examination may be repeated only once, and then only at the discretion of the thesis advisor.</span></p><h3 id="h.thl0tnjmal1x"><span class=" gdbold">Research Aptitude Examination (RAE)</span></h3><p><span></span></p><p><span>The doctoral research aptitude milestone is the second major milestone in the progression towards a Ph.D. degree. This exam is designed to foster and evaluate the student’s breadth of knowledge based on their performance in graduate level coursework and growing knowledge in their specific topic of interest. It also tests the student’s suitability for conducting competent research, which includes evaluating their technical writing and presentation skills.</span></p><h2 id="h.oqwzltye021o"><span class=" gdbold">General Requirements</span></h2><h3 id="h.cxdtzjoes04c"><span class=" gdbold">Doctoral Advisor</span></h3><p><span>It is the student’s responsibility to obtain consent from a full-time faculty member in the student’s major department to serve as his/her prospective doctoral advisor. It is strongly recommended that Ph.D. students find a doctoral advisor before taking the preliminary examination. After passing the preliminary examination, Ph.D. students must have an advisor before the beginning of the next quarter following the preliminary examination. Students currently pursuing a master’s degree at the time of their preliminary examination should have a doctoral advisor as soon as possible after being accepted as a Ph.D. student.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The student and the advisor jointly develop a complete program of studies for research in a particular area. The complete program of studies (and any subsequent changes) must be filed with the Graduate Programs Office and approved by the student’s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that courses taken will be acceptable toward the Ph.D. course requirements.</span></p><h3 id="h.algvha68x0bp"><span class=" gdbold">Doctoral Committee</span></h3><p><span>After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests their advisor to form a doctoral committee.
