At approximately one-third of the units required for a master’s degree, the certificate is designed to be completed in a much shorter period of time. These certificate programs are appropriate for students working in industry who wish to update their skills or for those interested in changing their career path.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><h2 id="h.rzsip97h0tkg"><span class=" gdbold">Interdisciplinary</span></h2><h3 id="h.evjau3og37l4"><span class=" gdbold">Certificate in Frugal Innovation </span></h3><p><span class=" gditalic">Advisor:</span><span> Dr. Drazen Fabris</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Over the past two decades, global trends have been forcing businesses to adapt to growing consumer bases in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which are in desperate need of low-cost and high-quality solutions to the challenges that they face. The importance of these new “economic realities” is underscored by the fact that emerging markets are expected to exceed 50% of the world’s GDP in 2017 (according to IMF estimates). In order to excel professionally in such an environment, engineers will have to be equipped with the knowledge and skill sets to appropriately define, design, and implement solutions that are not merely a “stripping down” of Western products to meet the rising demand. Industry, particularly in Silicon Valley, is becoming increasingly aware of this fact and has begun to move toward a ‘Triple Bottom Line’ approach to business, which integrates environmental, societal, and financial considerations. The Certificate in Frugal Innovation is designed to give students the ability and the tools to adapt to this new model, and to expand their understanding of the impact that engineering has on society.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>This program is suitable for working professionals in a wide variety of engineering disciplines. To enroll, students must have a B.S. in Engineering from an accredited institution and should maintain a GPA of at least 3.000 in order to receive the certificate.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Program Requirements</span></p><p><span>The Certificate in Frugal Innovation entails a minimum of 16 units of coursework.

The intent is to help equip professionals in Silicon Valley with the knowledge that will help them advance in their present careers or enter the renewable energy field. To enroll in this certificate, an applicant should have a B.S. in Engineering from an accredited school and should maintain a grade point average of 3.000. As with most certificates in the Graduate School of Engineering, the requirement is 16 quarter units. Eight of these units are in Power Systems, eight units are in Renewable Energy.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Required Courses (16 units total)</span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Power Systems (8 units)</span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_e3iot4g31e5x-0 start"><li><span>ECEN 280/MECH 288 Renewable Energy (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ECEN 281A Power Systems: Generation and Transmission (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ECEN 281B Power Systems Distribution (2 units) or ECEN 281E (4 units)</span></li><li><span>ECEN 285 Introduction to the Smart Grid (2 units)</span></li></ul><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Renewable Energy (8 units)</span><span class=" gditalic"> </span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_k2z4j9k2s2kp-0 start"><li><span>ECEN 284 Solar Cell Technologies and Simulation Tools (2 units) or ECEN 380 Economics of Energy (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ECEN/MECH 286 Introduction to Wind Energy Engineering (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ECEN 287/MECH 287 Storage Device Systems (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ENGR/GREN 272 Energy Public Policy (2 units)</span></li></ul><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><h3 id="h.imor8htsl3c5"><span class=" gdbold">Bioengineering Certificate</span></h3><p><span class=" gdbold">Online Graduate Certificate in Applied Bioengineering</span></p><p><span class=" gditalic">Advisor: </span><span>Dr. Prashanth Asuri</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The primary goal of the online graduate certificate is to provide a graduate-level introduction to recent graduates and professionals wishing to explore the field of applied bioengineering.
