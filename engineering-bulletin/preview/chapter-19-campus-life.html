The primary educational objective in supporting student activities and organizations is to foster a community that is enriched by men and women of diverse backgrounds, wherein freedom of inquiry and expression enjoys high priority.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p id="h.30j0zll"><span>The following sections describe various aspects of student life and services.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2 id="h.9ukw9y2vncq0"><span class=" gdbold">Campus Ministry </span></h2><p><span></span></p><p><span>The Office of Campus Ministry supports the faith and spirituality of all students at Santa Clara University.  Because the University is grounded in the Catholic and Jesuit traditions, we welcome people of all faiths - those seeking a deeper relationship with God through their own faiths, as well as people seeking meaning and connection in their lives.  The professional ministry staff members are committed to building a campus community and supporting the full humanity of all people by fostering spirituality, wellness, and belonging. In addition to six full-time campus ministers, the office includes student ministry interns, spirituality facilitators in the residence halls, and desk assistants who foster hospitality. Our stance in Campus Ministry reflects our shared Jesuit that our faith comes alive when we work for justice in the world.</span></p><h3 id="h.e1bjvwekibza"><span class=" gdbold">What does Campus Ministry have to offer?</span></h3><ul class="lst-kix_4x9vxqfsx15m-0 start"><li><span class=" gdbold">Worship: </span><span>During the academic year, we sponsor three Sunday liturgies in the Mission Church, daily noon Mass, and annual Masses celebrating the University’s Catholic and Jesuit traditions. Throughout the year, the campus community is invited to participate in Misas en Español, the sacrament of reconciliation, and prayer services across campus to mark holidays both religious and secular across all faith denominations.</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Intercultural Ministry:</span><span> Campus Ministry staff support a wide variety of cultural identity and faith-based student-led organizations.  We also have intercultural celebrations in observance of events such as Día de los Muertos, Simbang Gabi, Las Posadas, la Virgen de Guadalupe, and Lunar New Year, as well as intercultural liturgies for heritage months. In addition, Campus Ministry facilitates and participates in Mosaic events, which are multicultural and multifaith gatherings of students. Mosaic gatherings include monthly dinners, wellness events, campus-wide socials, and sacred space tours.</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Retreats:</span><span> Santa Clara students are offered a number of retreat experiences over the course of the academic year. </span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Spirituality and reflection groups: </span><span>Campus Ministry organizes Ignatian Life Communities are opportunities for students to explore spiritual practice and identity in small groups of their peers.  Other opportunities include Mosaic Dinner Discussions, weekly Breaking Open the Word (reflection on the lectionary readings), and a multifaith meditation group.  Individuals and groups seeking support to form reflection groups are encouraged to come to Campus Ministry for assistance.</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">LGBTQ+ Ministry: </span><span>The Office of Campus Ministry models respect and support for students of all identities and orientations through its programming and its hospitality. Specific support includes sponsoring an annual delegation of students to attend IgnatianQ, a conference for LGBTQ+ students from Jesuit universities to “create community, develop spirituality, and build humanity.” This conference has inspired the Ignatian Life Community Spiritual Queeries, a small group for queer students who are curious about the mysteries of the universe.</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Social justice awareness and action: </span><span>Campus Ministry provides students with a variety of opportunities to live out a faith that does justice. Some key focus areas include participation in the annual Ignatian Family Teach-in for Justice, and community service at a local school.</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Faith-based clubs: </span><span>In partnership with the Center for Student Involvement, Campus Ministry aids in the mentoring and support of all faith-based registered student organizations, including, for example, the Muslim Student Association, Students for Life, the Jewish Student Union, College Catholics, and the Sikh Student Association.</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Sacred spaces: </span><span>Throughout campus, there are spaces for prayer, meditation, and reflection, such as the Mission Church, the Multifaith Sanctuary in St. Joseph’s Hall, and the Meditation Room in Benson. All are welcome to find a place of rest in these sacred spaces.</span></li></ul><h3 id="h.niyc7l47awiy"><span class=" gdbold">Is Campus Ministry for everyone?</span></h3><p><span></span></p><p><span>Yes!

Campus Ministry welcomes all SCU community members to deepen their spiritual practice, faith, and identity, regardless of their tradition or personal stance.</span></p><p><span>“The real measure of a Jesuit education is who our students become. Tomorrow’s ‘whole person’ cannot be whole without well-educated solidarity…the whole person in solidarity for the real world.” - </span><span class=" gditalic">Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, Superior of the Society of Jesuits, speaking at Santa Clara University, October 2000</span><span>  </span></p><p><span>Our only focus is to support SCU community members to explore the connection between their commitments and their actions - to practice living faith and values more authentically ‘to build a more humane, just, and sustainable world.’</span></p><h2 id="h.8ryjtcg1vnx"><span class=" gdbold">Student Resources and Services</span></h2><p><span></span></p><p><span>Student Health, Counseling, and Well-Being promotes a holistic approach to students’ physical, emotional, psychological, and interpersonal well-being.
