EMGT students take core courses in organizational behavior, project management, systems engineering, finance, and marketing, augmented by additional courses in management and leadership. In parallel, students design a Technical Stem program to advance their knowledge in an advanced engineering discipline and round out their education with an Enrichment Experience. The combination of business and graduate-level engineering coursework prepares students for leadership roles in technologically sophisticated companies.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2 id="h.a0phf5hbiusi"><span class=" gdbold">Master of Science Program Requirements</span></h2><p><span>Admission to the Engineering Management and Leadership Program is open to those students who hold an undergraduate or graduate degree in engineering, mathematics, computer science, or engineering physics. The undergraduate degree must be from a four-year engineering program substantially equivalent to Santa Clara University’s.
