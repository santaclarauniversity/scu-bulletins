The work for the degree involves conducting in-depth bioengineering research, preparing a thesis based on the research findings, and a program of advanced studies in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences. The Bioengineering Department also offers an i</span><span>ndustrial track</span><span> for working professionals as an option to facilitate collaboration between academia and industry. Student’s work is directed by the degree-conferring department, subject to the general supervision of the School of Engineering.</span></p><h3 id="h.icfmjhchg2dd"><span class=" gdbold">Preliminary Examination</span></h3><p><span>The preliminary examination will be in written format and include subject matter deemed by the major department to represent sufficient preparation in depth and breadth for advanced study in the major. Only those who pass the written examination may take the oral qualifying examination.</span></p><p><span>Students currently studying at Santa Clara University for a master’s degree who are accepted to the Ph.D. program and who are at an advanced stage of the M.S. program may, with the approval of their academic advisor, take the preliminary examination before completing the M.S. degree requirements. Students who have completed the M.S. degree requirements and have been accepted to the Ph.D. program should take the preliminary examination as soon as possible but not more than two years after beginning the program.</span></p><p><span>Students are expected to pass an exam in biostatistics as well as two additional exams from the following areas: biodevices or bioimaging, biomolecular or bioprocess engineering, biomaterials or biofabrication, and computational bioengineering. At the thesis advisor’s discretion, students may be expected to take and pass an exam in three areas (in addition to biostatistics) from the above list. Students opting to pursue the computational bioengineering focus may choose a different exam topic instead of biostatistics. Only those students who pass the preliminary examination shall be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. The preliminary examination may be retaken once, and any additional retakes are at the discretion of the thesis advisor.</span></p><h3 id="h.t9ykr32s7c6r"><span class=" gdbold">Doctoral Advisor</span></h3><p><span>It is the student’s responsibility to obtain consent from a full-time faculty member in the student’s major department to serve as his/her prospective thesis advisor.</span><span> </span><span>It is strongly recommended that Ph.D. students find a doctoral advisor before taking the preliminary examination. After passing the preliminary examination, Ph.D. students must have a doctoral advisor before the beginning of the next quarter following the preliminary examination. Students currently pursuing a master’s degree at the time of their preliminary examination should have a doctoral advisor as soon as possible after being accepted as a Ph.D. student.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The student and the doctoral advisor jointly develop a complete program of studies for research in a particular area. The complete program of studies (and any subsequent changes) must be filed with the Graduate Services Office and approved by the student’s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that the courses taken will be acceptable toward the Ph.D. course requirements.</span></p><h3 id="h.ue8fri1ird9t"><span class=" gdbold">Doctoral Committee</span></h3><p><span></span></p><p><span>After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests their doctoral advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of which must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s doctoral advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, thesis defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members.</span></p><h3 id="h.ijd03wtxlvex"><span class=" gdbold"></span></h3><h3 id="h.a1xewnidaa9g"><span class=" gdbold"></span></h3><h3 id="h.izaipxc1tzo0"><span class=" gdbold">Residence</span></h3><p><span></span></p><p><span>The doctoral degree is granted on the basis of achievement, rather than on the accumulation of units of credit. However, the candidate is expected to complete a minimum of 72 quarter units of graduate credit beyond the master’s degree. Of these, 36 quarter units may be earned through coursework and independent study, and 36 through the thesis. All Ph.D. thesis units are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. A maximum of 18 quarter units (12 semester units) may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor.</span></p><p><span>Ph.D. students must undertake a minimum of four consecutive quarters of full-time study at the University; spring and fall quarters are considered consecutive. The residency time shall normally be any period between passing the preliminary examination and completion of the thesis. For this requirement, full-time study is interpreted as a minimum registration of eight units per quarter during the academic year and four units during the summer session. Any variation from this requirement must be approved by the doctoral committee.</span></p><h3 id="h.aggpo6e7epjj"><span class=" gdbold">Comprehensive Examinations and Admission to Candidacy</span></h3><p><span></span></p><p><span>After completion of the formal coursework approved by the doctoral committee, the student shall present their research proposal for comprehensive oral examinations on the coursework and the subject of their research work. The student should make arrangements for the comprehensive examinations through the doctoral committee. A student who passes the comprehensive examinations is considered a degree candidate.
