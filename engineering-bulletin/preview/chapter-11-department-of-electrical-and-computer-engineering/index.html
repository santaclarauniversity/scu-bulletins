Electrical and computer engineers work with information representation, processing and transmission; advancing integrated circuit design for digital, analog, and mixed signals systems; designing and characterizing antennas, RF, microwave and millimeter-wave Systems; new devices and architectures, energy systems and renewable energy; nanotechnology; and all the areas of information circuits and systems that have traditionally supported these efforts. This includes all phases of the digital or analog transmission of information, such as in mobile communications and networks, radio, television, telephone systems, fiber optics, and satellite communications, as well as control and robotics, electric power, information processing and storage.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The Electrical and Computer Engineering Programs are supported by the facilities of the University’s Academic Computing Center, as well as by the Engineering Computing Center. The department supports 10 major teaching and research laboratories, five additional laboratories used only for teaching, and a laboratory dedicated to the support of design projects. The five teaching laboratories cover the fields of digital systems, electric circuits, electronics, systems,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and RF and communication and signal processing and control systems, logic design and digital systems, In addition, the program has a laboratory dedicated to senior design projects.</span></p><p><span>Programs are offered which lead to a Master’s Degree, a Ph.D. degree, an Engineer’s Degree, or a Certificate. Each is described below. </span></p><p><span></span></p><h4 id="h.vad02rq6ztzy"><span class=" gdbold">Master’s Degree Program and Requirements</span></h4><p><span>The master’s degree will be granted to degree candidates who complete a program of studies approved by a faculty advisor. The program must consist of no less than 46 units, and a 3.000 cumulative GPA (B average) must be earned in all coursework taken at Santa Clara University. Residence requirements are met by completing no less than 37 units of the graduate program at Santa Clara University. A maximum of nine quarter units (six-semester units) of graduate-level coursework may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor. All units applied toward the degree, including those transferred from other institutions, must be earned within six years from initial enrollment. </span><span>The program may include a thesis or a research component of smaller scope that does not require a thesis.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The program requires that students select one of these defined focus areas within electrical and computer engineering.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Power Systems and Control</span></p><p><span>Autonomous cars, space shuttles, robots, IoT and airplanes all have sophisticated control strategies. The electric utility industry is probably the largest and most complex industry in the world. How this network operates, and how it can be controlled, and how to integrate renewable energies into the grid in order to have cleaner and more sustainable energy are major challenges.</span><span> </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Faculty Advisors: Maryam Khanbaghi, Aleksandar Zecevic</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">IC Design and Technology</span></p><p><span>The study of integrated circuits (IC) (generally known as semiconductors or chips) consists of three interconnected areas of pedagogy, Circuit Design, Device Physics, and Fabrication Process Technology. One cannot imagine the world now and in the future without chips, which are in your home, in your workplace, in your automobile, and in all your electronic devices. With worldwide chips revenue projected to approach $1 trillion by 2030, the semiconductor industry, not unlike its energy counterpart, supplies the critical goods and services that sustain and advance human civilization.</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Faculty Advisors: Shoba Krishnan, Cary Yang, Mahmudur Rahman</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">RF and Applied Electromagnetics</span></p><p><span>From 5G and the internet of things to automotive radar, high frequency and wireless systems are pervasive in nearly every aspect of modern technology.  To prepare engineers for careers in these contemporary fields, the RF and Applied Electromagnetics program provides the fundamental theoretical and applied knowledge for design, analysis, and implementation of high frequency circuits and systems.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Faculty </span><span>Advisor: Kurt Schab</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Signal Processing and Machine Learning</span></p><p><span>Signal processing algorithms, architectures, and systems are at the heart of modern technologies that generate, transform, and interpret information across applications as diverse as communications, robotics and autonomous navigation, biotechnology and entertainment. This focus area includes courses in theory, architectures, implementations, and specific applications including computer vision and speech processing.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Faculty Advisors: Maria Kyrarini, Tokunbo Ogunfunmi, Sally Wood</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Digital Systems</span></p><p><span>Digital systems include the three broad areas of computer architecture, digital design principles, techniques and verification, and embedded systems. Systems that execute software, whether they be general-purpose computers or computing platforms (digital platforms) embedded into a targeted application, fall into the category of digital systems, as do special purpose hardware implementations that might be realized with an FPGA or manufactured as an ASIC.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Faculty Advisors: Hoeseok Yang</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Communication Systems and Information Theory</span></p><p><span>Information systems are vital to modern technology, driving a broad spectrum of applications from wireless networks and internet security to machine learning and AI.

For each breadth area, one course must be taken from the list of required courses for that area.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>    5. Additional graduate courses recommended and approved by the graduate program advisor. This may include up to 6 units of Directed Research (299) and up to 9 units of Master’s Thesis Research (297). More detailed information about the Master’s Thesis can be found below.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>These M.S. degree requirements may be adjusted by the advisor based on the student’s previous graduate work.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>An advisor may approve selected undergraduate classes that do not duplicate course content of graduate courses in the program of studies. No more than 15 units of electives may be selected from the following upper-division undergraduate courses: 105, 112, 116, 117, 118, 130, 133, 141, 144, 151, 152, 156, 160, 164, 183 and 184.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Alterations in the approved program, consistent with the above departmental requirements, may be requested at any time by a petition initiated by the student and approved by the advisor.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Students with relevant technical backgrounds may be admitted to the master’s program without an undergraduate degree in electrical or electrical and computer engineering from an accredited program. In order to guarantee prerequisites for graduate courses, those students must take sufficient additional courses beyond the 46-unit minimum to ensure coverage of all areas of the undergraduate EE or ECE core requirements. A student who has earned a Fundamentals of Electrical and Computer Engineering Certificate will have satisfied these background requirements.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><p><span>The advisor will determine which courses must be taken to meet these requirements. Undergraduate core courses will not be included in the 46 units required for the master’s degree.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"><div class="bttooltip">Please Note: In general, no credit will be allowed for courses that duplicate prior coursework, including courses listed above as degree requirements. (However, graduate-level treatment of a topic is more advanced than an undergraduate course with a similar title.) Students should discuss any adjustments of these requirements with their academic advisor before filing their program of studies. In all cases, prerequisite requirements should be interpreted to mean the course specified or an equivalent course taken elsewhere.</div></span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"></span></p><h4 id="h.bv4cbt5zyrya"><span class=" gdbold">Master’s Thesis Research:</span></h4><p><span></span></p><p><span>Master’s thesis research consists of a minimum of 7 units and a maximum of 15 units, which are included in “Additional Elective Courses” in the Master’s Program of Study. The first stage of the research is 6 units of Directed Research, ECEN 299. Students with an average grade of B+ or higher may continue to stage 2, which is advanced research and thesis composition. This stage requires 1 to 9 units of ECEN 297 and the submission of the completed thesis to the University library.</span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"></span></p><h4 id="h.h00p1ov8opae"><span class=" gdbold">Ph.D. Program and Requirements</span></h4><p><span>The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is conferred by the School of Engineering primarily in recognition of competence in the subject field and the ability to investigate engineering problems independently, resulting in a new contribution to knowledge in the field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a thesis based on that research, publication of the research, and a program of advanced studies in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Preliminary Examination</span></p><p><span>The preliminary examination shall be written and shall include subject matter deemed by the major department to represent sufficient preparation in depth and breadth for advanced study in the major. Only those who pass the written examination may proceed to the subsequent Research Aptitude and Comprehensive examination.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Students currently studying at Santa Clara University for a master’s degree who are accepted for the Ph.D. program and who are at an advanced stage of the M.S. program may, with the approval of their academic advisor, take the preliminary examination before completing the M.S. degree requirements. Students who have completed the M.S. degree requirements and have been accepted for the Ph.D. program should take the preliminary examination as soon as possible but not more than two years after beginning the program.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Only those students who pass the preliminary examination shall be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. The preliminary examination may be repeated only once, and then only at the discretion of the thesis advisor.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><h4 id="h.thl0tnjmal1x"><span class=" gdbold">Research Aptitude Examination (RAE)</span></h4><p><span></span></p><p><span>The doctoral research aptitude milestone is the second major milestone in the progression towards a Ph.D. degree. This exam is designed to foster and evaluate the student’s breadth of knowledge based on their performance in graduate level coursework and growing knowledge in their specific topic of interest. It also tests the student’s suitability for conducting competent research, which includes evaluating their technical writing and presentation skills.</span></p><h4 id="h.oqwzltye021o"><span class=" gdbold">General Requirements</span></h4><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Doctoral Advisor</span></p><p><span>It is the student’s responsibility to obtain consent from a full-time faculty member in the student’s major department to serve as his/her prospective doctoral advisor. It is strongly recommended that Ph.D. students find a doctoral advisor before taking the preliminary examination. After passing the preliminary examination, Ph.D. students must have an advisor before the beginning of the next quarter following the preliminary examination. Students currently pursuing a master’s degree at the time of their preliminary examination should have a doctoral advisor as soon as possible after being accepted as a Ph.D. student.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The student and the advisor jointly develop a complete program of studies for research in a particular area. The complete program of studies (and any subsequent changes) must be filed with the Graduate Programs Office and approved by the student’s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that courses taken will be acceptable toward the Ph.D. course requirements.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Doctoral Committee</span></p><p><span>After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests their advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of whom must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s doctoral advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, approves the required publication, and reviews the dissertation. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and dissertation meet with the approval of all committee members.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Residence</span></p><p><span>The doctoral degree is granted based on achievement, rather than on the accumulation of units of credit. However, the candidate is expected to complete a minimum of 72 quarter units of graduate credit beyond the master’s degree. Of these, 36 quarter units may be earned through coursework and independent study, and 36 through doctoral research units. All Ph.D. research units are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. A maximum of 18 quarter units (12-semester units) may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Ph.D. students must undertake a minimum of four consecutive quarters of full-time study at the University; spring and fall quarters are considered consecutive. The residency time shall normally be any period between passing the preliminary examination and completion of the thesis. For this requirement, full-time study is interpreted as a minimum registration of eight units per quarter during the academic year and four units during the summer session. Any variation from this requirement must be approved by the doctoral committee.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Comprehensive Examinations and Admission to Candidacy</span></p><p><span>After completion of the formal coursework approved by the doctoral committee, the student shall present their research proposal as part of a comprehensive oral examination on the coursework and the subject of their research work. This represents the third major milestone in the Ph.D. program. The student should make arrangements for the comprehensive examinations through the doctoral committee. A student who passes the comprehensive examinations is considered a degree candidate. The comprehensive examinations typically must be completed within four years from the time the student is admitted to the doctoral program. Comprehensive examinations may be repeated once, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the doctoral committee.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Doctoral Research and Dissertation Defense</span></p><p><span>The period following the comprehensive examinations is devoted to research, although such research may begin before the examinations are complete. After successfully completing the comprehensive examinations, the student must pass an oral examination on their research and dissertation, conducted by the doctoral committee and whomever they appoint as examiners. The dissertation must be made available to all examiners one month prior to the examination. The oral examination shall consist of a presentation of the research results and the defense. This examination is open to the public, but only members of the doctoral committee have a vote.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Dissertation and Publication</span></p><p><span>At least one month before the degree is to be conferred, the candidate must submit one copy of the final version of the dissertation to the department. The dissertation will not be considered as accepted until a copy signed by all committee members has been submitted to the library and one or more refereed articles based on it are accepted for publication in a first-tier professional or scientific journal approved by the doctoral committee. The final version of the dissertation must be filed with the library</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Time Limit for Completing Degree</span></p><p><span>All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. This includes any leave of absences/withdrawals. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee and approved by the dean of engineering in consultation with the Graduate Program Leadership Council.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Additional Graduation Requirements</span></p><p><span>The requirements for the doctoral degree in the School of Engineering have been made to establish the structure in which the degree may be earned. Upon written approval of the provost, the dean of the School of Engineering, the doctoral committee, and the chair of the major department, other degree requirements may be established. The University reserves the right to evaluate the undertakings and the accomplishments of the degree candidate in total, and award or withhold the degree as a result of its deliberations.</span><span class=" gdbold"> </span></p><p><span></span></p><h4 id="h.n8tcpx3bezw3"><span class=" gdbold">Engineer’s Degree Program and Requirements</span></h4><p><span>The program leading to the Engineer’s Degree is particularly designed for the education of the practicing engineer. The degree is granted on completion of an approved academic program and a record of acceptable technical achievement in the candidate’s field of engineering. The academic program consists of a minimum of 46 quarter units beyond the master’s degree. Courses are selected to advance competence in specific areas relating to the engineering professional’s work. Evidence of technical achievement must include a paper principally written by the candidate and accepted for publication by a recognized engineering journal prior to the granting of the degree. A letter from the journal accepting the paper must be submitted to the department chair. In certain cases, the department may accept publication in the peer-reviewed proceedings of an appropriate national or international conference.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Electrical and Computer Engineering courses at the introductory Master of Science level (e.g., ECEN 210, 211, 212, 230, 231, 236, 241, 250, 261; and AMTH 210, 211, 220, 221, 230, 231, 235, 236, 240, 245, 246) are not generally acceptable in an Engineer’s Degree program of studies. However, with the approval of the advisor, the student may include up to three of these courses in the Engineer’s Degree program. The department also requires that at least 15 units of the program of studies be in topics other than the student’s major field of concentration. Candidates admitted to the Electrical and Computer Engineering Program who have M.S. degrees in fields other than electrical and computer engineering must include in their graduate programs (M.S. and Engineer’s Degree combined) a total of at least 46 units of graduate-level electrical and computer engineering coursework approved by an academic advisor.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><h4 id="h.734ilv4670xw"><span class=" gdbold">Certificate Programs</span></h4><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">General Information</span></p><p><span>Certificate programs are designed to provide an intensive background in a narrow area at the graduate level.
