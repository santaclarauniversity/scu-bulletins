We offer a multi-disciplinary master’s degree in Robotics and Automation, which balances deep technical expertise with practical application-oriented experience and insight into the societal impacts, ethical challenges, and entrepreneurial opportunities relevant to this field. A technical core ensures competence in the areas of design, controls, and perception. Elective-based focus areas within the degree provide opportunities for students to build knowledge and expertise in application areas such as industrial internet-of-things and manufacturing, field robotics, etc. Furthermore, partnerships with local companies and agencies provide highly applicable project experiences, ensure a relevant curriculum, and contribute to a strong student recruitment pipeline. Finally, a novel co-curricular option certifies student competencies in modern skills and tools relevant to the robotics and automation industry.</span></p><h2 id="h.5vhs2cvk2pr4"><span class=" gdbold">Master’s Degree Program and Requirements</span></h2><p><span>Students interested in this major must satisfy the standard admissions criteria used by the School of Engineering, which include an undergraduate degree in a field of engineering or related area,  and demonstrated proficiency in English. Students must also have an academic background or be able to demonstrate proficiency in computer programming, electrical circuit design, and mechanical design; students deficient in one or more of these areas may be required to take additional courses in these areas at either the graduate or undergraduate level prior to entering or early in their degree program. Students are expected to maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.000 while enrolled in the program. They must also develop a Robotics and Automation Program of Studies with an academic advisor and file this document with the Graduate Services Office by the end of their first quarter at SCU.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The degree requires completion of a minimum of 46 graduate units, to include:</span></p><p><span></span></p><h3 id="h.9b5j5dpd9ve9"><span>Graduate Core (</span><span>Refer to Chapter 6</span><span class=" gdbold">)</span></h3><p><span>Graduate Core: one course from Engineering and Society</span><span> and one course from Professional Development (</span><span>minimum of 4 units)</span></p><p><span class=" gduline"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Mathematics (8 units)</span><span>: Students must complete at least one Applied Math 4-unit sequence in either linear algebra or probability.

These collections may evolve over time given technology trends; the program website lists current themes with affiliated industry partners and capstone/thesis opportunities.

Typically, any extra units would be completed by enrolling in additional technical elective courses; however, in some cases, it may be of interest to take courses such as the project management or systems engineering course sequences offered by the Engineering Management program.  Students may not apply the completion of one course to two different requirement categories, with the exception of the mathematics requirement.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Modern Tools/Skills Competency Badging (Optional)</span><span>: Students may participate in this competency certification system to develop verified capabilities, acknowledged through the awarding of a “badge,” in a variety of areas that are in great demand by employers. Some of these badges will be obtained through completion of courses within the program. Others may be incorporated into the required “culminating experience.” There may also be opportunities to participate in co-curricular non-credit workshops on some topics. Management of these competency badges is managed through an online design portfolio system available to all students.</span></p></body>
