These courses are concentrated in five emphases:</span><span class=" gdbold"> (1)</span><span> dynamics and controls; </span><span class=" gdbold">(2)</span><span> design and manufacturing;</span><span class=" gdbold"> (3) </span><span>mechanics and materials;</span><span class=" gdbold"> (4) </span><span>mechatronic systems engineering;</span><span class=" gdbold"> (5) </span><span>thermofluids and energy; and</span><span class=" gdbold"> (6)</span><span> AI+X. Educational efforts are channeled to expand the skills of prospective and practicing engineers, not only in understanding fundamentals but also in developing competence in analyzing engineering systems. The department offers graduate degrees at the master, engineer, and doctorate levels, as well as certificates.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2 id="h.deddcx8x6ma9"><span class=" gdbold">Master of Science Programs</span></h2><p><span>An M.S. degree requires a minimum of 46 units of study with an overall GPA of 3.000 or higher. The student must select one of the five areas of emphasis and develop a program of studies with an advisor. Courses taken to satisfy any particular requirement may be used to simultaneously satisfy additional requirements for which they are appropriate. Master of Science degrees must include the following:</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Engineering Core: </span><span>Please refer to Chapter 6 for the core list.

Up to 6 units of MECH 290 can be taken and counted toward the 46-unit requirement. Those who write a thesis or publish an article in a peer-reviewed journal can take 6 more units of MECH 299.
