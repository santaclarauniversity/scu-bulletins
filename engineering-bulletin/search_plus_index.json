Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, law, engineering, education, counseling psychology, pastoral ministries, and theology. The University boasts a diverse community of scholars offering a values-oriented curriculum characterized by small class sizes and a dedication to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education--educating the whole person for a life of service--run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs. The University was established as Santa Clara College on the site of the Mission Santa Clara de Asís, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally operated as a preparatory school and did not offer collegiate courses until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. One-third of the students were enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college’s preparatory and high school departments. Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added. In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business opened in 1926, and within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the country to receive national accreditation. For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admissions explosion—from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began the largest building program in school history, building eight residence halls, a student union, and an athletic stadium. In 1985, the University adopted “Santa Clara University” as its official name. University Vision, Mission And Fundamental Values Santa Clara University has adopted three directional statements to describe the kind of university it aspires to become (Strategic Vision), its core purpose and the constituencies it serves (University Mission), and the beliefs that guide its actions (Fundamental Values). Strategic Vision Santa Clara University will educate citizens and leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion, and cultivate knowledge and faith to build a more humane, just, and sustainable world. University Mission The University pursues its vision by creating an academic community that educates the whole person within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition, making student learning our central focus, continuously improving our curriculum and co-curriculum, strengthening our scholarship and creative work, and serving the communities of which we are a part in Silicon Valley and around the world. Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educational environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institutional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society. We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to thedevelopment of: Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily residential setting Graduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contributions to their fields In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for non-matriculated students. Fundamental Values The University is committed to these core values, which guide us in carrying out our mission and realizing our vision: Academic Excellence. We seek an uncompromising standard of excellence in teaching, learning, creativity, and scholarship within and across disciplines. Search for Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. We prize scholarship and creative work that advance human understanding, improve teaching and learning, and add to the betterment of society by illuminating the most significant problems of the day and exploring the enduring mysteries of life. In this search, our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering. Engaged Learning. We strive to integrate academic reflection and direct experience in the classroom and the community, especially to understand and improve the lives of those with the least education, power, and wealth. Commitment to Students. As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, we endeavor to educate the whole person. We nurture and challenge students--intellectually, spiritually, aesthetically, morally, socially, and physically–-preparing them for leadership and service to the common good in their professional, civic, and personal lives. Service to Others. We promote throughout the University a culture of service—service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its most disadvantaged members as we work with and for others to build a more humane, just, faith-filled, and sustainable world. Community and Diversity. We cherish our diverse and inclusive community of students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni, a community that is enriched by people of different backgrounds, respectful of the dignity of all its members, enlivened by open communication, and caring and just toward others. Jesuit Distinctiveness. We treasure our Jesuit heritage and tradition, which incorporates all of these core values. This tradition gives expression to our Jesuit educational mission and Catholic identity while also welcoming and respecting other religious and philosophical traditions, promoting the dialogue between faith and culture, and valuing opportunities to deepen religious beliefs. Academic Programs Santa Clara University offers undergraduate degrees leading to the bachelor of arts (B.A.), bachelor of science (B.S.), and bachelor of science in commerce. The College of Arts and Sciences offers the B.A. degree and the B.S. degree in 33 subject areas and includes the graduate program in pastoral ministries, through which it offers the master of arts (M.A.) degree in catechetic, pastoral liturgy, spirituality, and liturgical music.

The engineering school also offers the doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in computer science and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. The two departments in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offer credential and graduate programs. The Department of Education focuses on preparing teachers and administrators for public and Catholic schools. It offers programs in teacher preparation leading to credentials (e.g., California preliminary multiple-subject and single-subject teaching credentials, and California Clear credential) and the master of arts in teaching (MAT) degree. Its programs in educational administration prepare public K–12 administrators for credentials (e.g.,the Preliminary California Administrative Services credential and the California Clear Administrative Services credential), and Catholic school leaders through the certificate program in Catholic School Leadership. The department also offers an M.A. program in interdisciplinary education (with emphasis in curriculum and instruction; science, technology, environmental education, and mathematics [STEEM]; and educational administration). The departments of Education and Counseling Psychology jointly offer the certificate program in Alternative and Correctional Education. The Department of Counseling Psychology offers two degree programs: M.A. in counseling psychology and M.A. in counseling. The M.A. in counseling psychology can lead to state licensure for marriage and family therapists and/or licensed professional clinical counselors. The department includes emphasis programs in health, correctional, and Latinx counseling. The Jesuit School of Theology (JST) is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the United States operated by the Society of Jesus, as the order of Catholic priests is known. It is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the country that offer three ecclesiastical degrees certified by the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education, and it also offers four advanced theological degrees certified by the Association of Theological Schools. In addition, JST offers a spiritual renewal program for clergy, religious, and lay people, and conducts an annual Instituto Hispano that offers a certificate program to advance Hispanic leadership in the pastoral life of the church. Centers of Distinction Santa Clara University has three Centers of Distinction that serve as major points of interaction between the University and local and global communities. Each center focuses on a theme that is central to Santa Clara’s distinctive mission as a Jesuit university and offers an educational environment integrating rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. Each center engages faculty and students from different disciplines as well as experts and leaders from the community through speakers, conferences, workshops, and experiential learning opportunities. Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship The mission of the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship is to accelerate entrepreneurship to end global poverty for the next generation.We fuse the entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley with the University's Jesuit heritage of service to the poor and protection of the planet, catalyzing innovative, sustainable solutions to poverty, and guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goals.Through an array of programs, including our signature Global Social Benefit Institute (GSBI™) accelerator program and award-winning Global Social Benefit Fellowship (GSBF), the Center engages an international network of social enterprises, investment capital, and technical resources to build the capacity of the global social entrepreneurship movement.

More than half of the alumni live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many are leaders in business, law, engineering, academia, and public service. These graduates connect with one another and the current campus community by engaging with over 45 different groups organized around identity, industry, and location. Campus The University is located on a 106-acre campus in the city of Santa Clara near the southern end of the San Francisco Bay in one of the world’s great cultural centers. More than 50 buildings on campus house 15 student residences, a main library, a law library, two student centers, the de Saisset Museum, extensive performing arts and athletic facilities, and a recreation and fitness center. Santa Clara’s campus has the advantage of being located in Silicon Valley—a region known for its extraordinary visionaries, who have designed and created some of the most significant scientific and technological advances of our age. Silicon Valley is more than a location—it is a mindset and home to more than 3million residents and 6,600 science- and technology-related companies, (not including San Francisco, which is located just an hour away). Santa Clara’s campus is well known for its beauty and Mission-style architecture. Opened in 2013, the brick-paved Abby Sobrato Mall leads visitors from the University’s main entrance to the heart of campus—the Mission Santa Clara de Asís. The rose gardens and palm and olive trees of the Mission Gardens surround the historic Mission Church, which was restored in 1928. The adjacent Adobe Lodge is the oldest building on campus. In 1981, it was restored to its 1822 decor. Academic Facilities Amid all this beauty and history are modern, world-class academic facilities. Students study and thrive in places such as the Joanne E. Harrington Learning Commons, Sobrato Family Technology Center and Orradre Library where individuals and groups can study in an inviting, light-filled, and open environment. Notably, the library features an Automated Retrieval System, a high-density storage area where up to 900,000 books and other publications can be stored and retrieved using robotic-assisted technology. Another example of Santa Clara’s excellent academic facilities is Lucas Hall, home of the Leavey School of Business. This modern 85,000-square-foot building houses classrooms, meeting rooms, offices, study spaces, and a café. Classrooms are equipped with state-of-the-art videoconferencing equipment as well as a multiplatform system to record faculty lectures for later review by students. Vari Hall (formerly Arts and Sciences) adjacent to Lucas Hall is home to the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics as well as academic departments, classrooms, and a 2,200-square-foot digital television studio—among the best found on any campus nationwide. Located near Varsi Hall is the Schott Admission and Enrollment Services Building, a welcome center for campus visitors and home to several University departments. Opened in 2012, the lobby of this LEED Gold equivalent structure includes technology-infused exhibits that illustrate Santa Clara’s Jesuit mission.

The building has classrooms, Innovation Zone, teaching and research labs, engineering and science shops, faculty and staff offices, collaboration spaces, and cafe. The Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship and the Frugal Innovation Hub will also find their new homes in this new state of the art building. The central landscaped courtyard and rooftop terraces, provide excellent places for gathering, which makes this new building a great addition to the heart of the campus. Student Life The Robert F. Benson Memorial Center serves as a hub for campus life. The Benson Memorial Center offers dining services and houses the campus bookstore, student and administrative offices, lounges,and meeting rooms. The University’s main dining hall, The Marketplace, resembles an upscale food court with numerous stations and options. For a more informal experience, The Bronco is the Benson Center’s late-night venue, serving beverages and pub-style food. Another hotspot for student life, the Paul L. Locatelli, S.J., Student Activity Center includes a 6,000-square-foot gathering hall with a high ceiling that can accommodate dances and concerts as well as pre- and post-game activities. Designed with environmental sensitivity, the building is energy efficient and has daytime lighting controls and motion sensors to maximize use of natural light. For fitness-minded students, the Pat Malley Fitness and Recreation Center features a 9,500-square-foot weight training and cardiovascular exercise room, three basketball courts, a swimming pool, and other facilities to support the recreational and fitness needs of the campus community. The campus features many locations for quiet reflection as well, such as the St. Clare Garden, which features plants and flowers arranged into five groups to portray the stages of the saint’s life. For campus members who want a more hands-on relationship with nature, the Forge Garden, SCU’s half-acre organic garden, serves as a campus space for course research, service learning, and sustainable food production. Athletics And The Arts The importance of athletics to the University is evident everywhere on campus. Among the newest additions to Santa Clara's athletics facilities are the Stephen Schott Stadium, home field for the men's baseball team, and the state-of-the-art Stevens Soccer Training Center, funded by a gift from Mary and Mark Stevens. The gift also allowed Santa Clara to upgrade the stands in Stevens Stadium (formerly Buck Shaw Stadium), home to the men's and women's soccer programs, and build a plaza to celebrate Bronco sports---its past, present, and future. The plaza celebrates the history of Santa Clara University football as well as the legacy and future of men's and women's soccer at SCU. Bellomy Field, eight acres of well-lit and grassy playing fields, provides space for club and intramural sports, such as rugby and field hockey. Adjacent to Bellomy Field is the well-appointed women's softball field, which opened in 2013. The Leavey Event Center houses the University's premier basketball facility. Over the years, the Leavey Event Center has hosted nine West Coast Conference Basketball Championships. The University recognizes the arts as an important part of life at Santa Clara University. The Edward M. Dowd Art and Art History Building opened in 2016, housing an integrated fine arts program that is a destination and a center for inspiration, innovation, and engagement in the arts and art history in Silicon Valley. An important arts destination in the Bay Area, the Department of Art and Art History\\s gallery exhibits artwork from a diverse group of established and emerging artists, and provides a dynamic teaching and learning resource for faculty, staff, students and the community.The de Saisset Museum, the University's accredited museum of art and history, presents changing art exhibitions throughout the year and serves as the caretaker of the University's California History Collection, which includes artifacts from the Native American, Mission, and early Santa Clara College periods.

The School of Engineering offers a large variety of programs to meet the needs of these engineering professionals. B.S./M.S. Five-year Dual Degree Program The School of Engineering offers qualified Santa Clara University undergraduates the opportunity to earn both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science degree in five years. This is an excellent way to save time and open-up more career possibilities early on. The degree is offered in Aerospace Engineering, Bioengineering, Computer Science Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Engineering Management and Leadership**, Mechanical Engineering, Robotics and Automation and Power Systems and Sustainable Energy. This program is also open to students in the College of Arts and Sciences who are majoring in mathematics, biology, computer science or engineering physics. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences interested in a B.S./M.S. program in Civil, Environmental, and Sustainable Engineering should consult the CESE department chapter of the graduate bulletin for details. The application fee and GRE General Test requirement are waived. Automatic admission into the five-year program is based on a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the major. Upon notification of acceptance into the B.S./M.S. program, students may begin taking graduate-level courses in their senior year and a maximum of 20 units can be transferred into the graduate program. Students must meet with a graduate advisor and submit a program of studies with the undergraduate transfer credit listed when they officially start the master’s program. Please Note: Undergraduate students will be charged the current undergraduate tuition rate while enrolled in those graduate courses. Once students have been matriculated into the master’s degree program, current graduate tuition rates will be charged. **For more information on the engineering management and leadership option, please see Chapter 13. Certificate Programs Certificate programs are designed to provide intensive background in a focused area at the graduate level. With 16-20 required units for completion, each certificate is designed to be completed in a much shorter period of time than an advanced degree. Santa Clara’s certificate programs are appropriate for students working in industry who wish to update their skills or for those interested in changing their career path. All units applied toward the certificate program must be earned within a two year period. Students enrolled in the certificate program should only take courses that will satisfy their certificate completion. Any course substitutions or waivers must be pre-approved by the certificate advisor. All Santa Clara University courses applied toward the completion of a certificate program earn graduate credit that may also be applied toward a graduate degree, subject to the requirements of the degree program (16-20 units can be transferred to the MS program depending on the certificate requirements). Students who wish to continue for such a degree must submit a separate application and satisfy all normal admission requirements. The general Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test requirement for graduate admission to the master’s degree program will be waived for students who have been formally admitted to and who have completed a certificate program with a GPA of 3.5 or better. Certificate programs are offered in frugal innovation, renewable energy, digital system design, integrated circuit design and technology, digital signal processing and machine learning, digital signal processing theory, fundamentals of electrical and computer engineering, RF and applied electromagnetics, controls, dynamics and vibrations, materials engineering, mechanical design analysis, mechatronics systems engineering, and thermofluid,. For more specific information on each certificate, please see Chapter 18. Please Note: Santa Clara University does not issue F-1 visas to applicants who wish to enter directly into the certificate program. Master Of Science Program The master’s program is designed to extend the technical breadth and depth of an engineer’s knowledge. Students in this program complete a program of studies approved by the faculty advisor in the major department. The program must include no less than 46 quarter units, and a 3.0 GPA (B average) must be earned in all coursework taken at Santa Clara. Residence requirements of the University are met by completing 36 quarter units of the graduate program at Santa Clara. MS students have six years to complete their Master’s degree. A maximum of 9 quarter units (6 semester units) of graduate-level coursework may be transferred from other accredited institutions that have not been applied to a previous degree at the discretion of the student’s advisor. All units applied toward the degree, including those transferred from other institutions, must be earned within a six-year period. Students have the option to write a thesis as part of their master’s degree. Students who choose this option are responsible for obtaining an advisor for their thesis work. The maximum number of units awarded for the master’s thesis is nine. Please note that the thesis option is not available in the Engineering Management and Leadership Program. The School of Engineering offers Master’s programs in Aerospace Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, , Electrical and Computer Engineering, Engineering Management and Leadership, Mechanical Engineering, Robotics and Automation, and Power Systems and Sustainable Energy. The coursework requirements for the degree are determined by each of the major departments. In order to graduate, students must complete the required coursework for the program to which they are admitted and must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 in all coursework listed on their approved program of study. In addition to this requirement, Engineering Management and Leadership degree candidates must earn a 3.0 GPA in those courses applied to their technical stem and a 3.0 GPA in their engineering management course stem. Please note: Only classes with assigned grades of C- or higher will count toward the completion of the certificates, M.S., or Ph.D. degrees. The grades of all courses completed during the M.S., Ph.D. or certificate program are used to compile final cumulative grade point average (GPA) Note that the number of engineering management courses accepted for other degrees in the graduate engineering program is restricted to six units in computer science engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and most options of mechanical engineering. Graduate Minor In Science, Technology, And Society (STS) The graduate minor in science, technology, and society (STS) is designed to help students gain a deeper understanding of the influence that engineering has on society (and vice versa). Knowledge of this kind has become essential in an increasingly complex and interconnected world, in which purely technical expertise often needs to be supplemented by additional skills. In order to successfully operate in such an environment, engineers must (at the very least) have the ability to communicate clearly, function on interdisciplinary and diverse teams, and make ethically and socially responsible decisions. The minor consists of a Core and a set of electives and entails a minimum of 12 units of coursework. It is open to all students who are pursuing a master’s degree in engineering, regardless of the specific program in which they are enrolled. For more comprehensive information, please see Chapter 17. Engineer’s Degree Program The program leading to the engineer’s degree is particularly designed for the education of the practicing engineer. It is offered in the computer science and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering departments. The degree is granted on completion of an approved academic program and a record of acceptable technical achievement in the student’s field of engineering. The academic program consists of a minimum of 46 quarter units beyond the master’s degree. Courses are selected to advance competence in specific areas relating to the engineering professional’s work. Evidence of technical achievement must include a paper principally written by the student and accepted for publication by a recognized engineering journal prior to the granting of the degree. A letter from the journal accepting the paper must be submitted to the department chairperson. In certain cases, the department may accept publication in the proceedings of an appropriate conference. Admission to the program will generally be granted to those students who demonstrate superior ability in meeting the requirements for their master’s degree. Normally, the master’s degree is earned in the same field as that in which the engineer’s degree is sought. Students who have earned a master’s degree from Santa Clara University must file a new application (by the deadline) to continue work toward the engineer’s degree. A program of studies for the engineer’s degree should be developed with the assistance of an advisor and submitted during the first term of enrollment. Doctor Of Philosophy Program The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is sought by those engineers who wish to become experts in a specific area within their field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a thesis based on that research, and a program of advanced studies in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences. The student’s work is directed by the degree-conferring department, subject to the general supervision of the School of Engineering. The school grants the Ph.D. in computer science and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. Preliminary Examination The preliminary examination shall be written and/or oral and shall include subject matter deemed by the major department to represent sufficient preparation in depth and breadth for advanced study in the major. Students currently studying at Santa Clara University for a master’s degree who are accepted for the Ph.D. program and who are at an advanced stage of the M.S. program may, with the approval of their academic advisor, take the preliminary examination before completing the M.S. degree requirements. Students who have completed the M.S. degree requirements and have been accepted for the Ph.D. program should take the preliminary examination as soon as possible but not more than one and one-half years after beginning the program. Only those students who pass the preliminary examination shall be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. The preliminary examination may be repeated only once and only at the discretion of the thesis advisor. Thesis Advisor It is the student’s responsibility to obtain consent from a full-time faculty member in the student’s major department to serve as his/her prospective thesis advisor. It is strongly recommended that Ph.D. students find a thesis advisor before taking the preliminary examination. After passing the preliminary examination, Ph.D. students should have a thesis advisor before the beginning of the next quarter following the preliminary examination. Students currently pursuing a master’s degree at the time of their preliminary examination should have a thesis advisor as soon as possible after being accepted as a Ph.D. student. The student and the thesis advisor jointly develop a complete program of studies for research in a particular area. The complete program of studies (and any subsequent changes) must be filed with Engineering Graduate Programs and approved by the student’s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that courses taken will be counted toward the Ph.D. course requirements. Doctoral Committee After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of which must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members. Residence The Ph.D. degree is granted on the basis of academic achievement. The student is expected to complete a minimum of 72 units of graduate credit beyond the master’s degree with an overall GPA of 3.0 or better. Please note: Only classes with assigned grades of C- or higher will count toward the completion of the certificates, M.S., or Ph.D. degrees. Of these, 36 quarter units may be earned through coursework, independent study and directed research, and 36 through the thesis. Deviation from this distribution must be approved by the student’s doctoral committee and must not be more than six units. All Ph.D. thesis units are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. A maximum of 18 quarter units (12 semester units), not previously used for the completion of another degree, may be transferred from any accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor. Comprehensive Examinations and Admission to Candidacy After completion of the formal coursework approved by the doctoral committee, the student shall present his/her research proposal for comprehensive oral examinations on the subject of his/her research work. The student should make arrangements for the comprehensive examinations through the doctoral committee. A student who passes the comprehensive examinations is considered a degree candidate. The comprehensive examinations normally must be completed within four years from the time the student is admitted to the doctoral program. These examinations may be repeated once, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the doctoral committee. Thesis Research and Defense The period following the comprehensive examinations is devoted to research for the thesis, although such research may begin before the examinations are complete. After successfully completing the comprehensive examinations, the student must pass an oral examination on his/her research, conducted by the doctoral committee and whomever they appoint as examiners. The thesis must be made available to all examiners one month prior to the examination. The oral examination shall consist of a presentation of the results of the thesis and the defense. This examination is open to all faculty members of Santa Clara University, but only members of the doctoral committee have a vote. Thesis and Publication At least one month before the degree is conferred, the candidate must submit one copy of the final version of the thesis to the department and one copy to the University Library. The thesis will not be considered as accepted until approved by the doctoral committee and one or more refereed articles based on it are accepted for publication in a professional or scientific journal approved by the doctoral committee. The quality of the refereed journal must be satisfied by one of two criteria: (1) the refereed journal should have an impact factor of at least 1.0 or (2) prior to submitting the candidate’s work to a refereed journal, written approvals on satisfying the journal’s quality should be obtained from the candidate’s advisor, the doctoral committee, the department chair, and the dean’s office. This written approval must be kept in the candidate’s file. Time Limit for Completing Degrees All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee and approved by the Dean of Engineering in consultation with the Graduate Program Leadership Council. (GPLC) Non-Enrollment Period Ph.D. students are required to enroll in at least one unit for the fall, winter, spring quarters and their final graduating quarter. Those who do not wish to enroll must submit a leave of absence or a withdrawal form to the Engineering Graduate Programs office. A leave of absence form is required if a student plans to miss one or two quarters, while any longer absence requires a withdrawal form. Students who wish to resume their Ph.D. studies after a leave of absence or withdrawal must submit a returning student form. The forms can be found on the graduate engineering website, www.scu.edu/engineering/graduate under current student resources. Leave of absence or withdrawal forms must be submitted by the end of the first week of the quarter. Returning student forms must be submitted three weeks prior to the start of the quarter returning. Please note the request is not guaranteed. Students are required to complete their degree within eight years from their original admit term date. The eight-year time frame includes quarters during which a student was not enrolled. Those who fail to complete their Ph.D. in eight years can request an extension only under special circumstances. In such cases, the student’s advisor will need to discuss the case with the Graduate Program Leadership Council (GPLC), which will determine whether an extension is warranted (and for how long). Please Note: Students who miss one or more quarters and fail to submit the appropriate form(s) will be discontinued automatically and will have to submit a returning student form or reapply to the Ph.D. program. They will need to follow the same procedure as students who withdrew from the program. Additional Graduation Requirements The requirements for the doctoral degree in the School of Engineering have been made to establish the structure in which the degree may be earned. The student’s Ph.D. committee looks at the proposed research and the prior background of the student to determine whether or not there are specific courses that must be added as requirements. The University reserves the right to evaluate the undertakings and the accomplishments of the degree candidate in total and award or withhold the degree as a result of its deliberations. The Industrial Track In addition to our regular Ph.D. program, Engineering Graduate Programs also offers an “industrial track” for working professionals as an option to facilitate the collaboration between academia and industry. Details are as follows: The topic of the research should be coordinated with the needs of the candidate’s employer and must be agreed upon by all parties. This topic must have a component that is publishable and is presentable in open forums. If necessary, a collaborative research agreement will be enacted to indicate the rights of the School and the industrial partner. As a part of the application process, candidates must submit a letter of support from their employer. This letter should contain a pledge of financial support and must identify a co-advisor within the company. The co-advisor shares responsibilities for guiding the candidate’s research with a full- time faculty advisor. This person is also expected to be a member of the doctoral committee. The full-time study component of the residence requirement is waived, but other residence requirements remain the same. Students who opt for this “industrial track” are responsible for meeting all other requirements for the Ph.D. The awarded degree will be the same for all students, regardless of the track that they choose to pursue. Open University Program Engineers who wish to update their skills or learn new technologies without pursuing a specific degree may enroll in the School of Engineering’s Open University program. If a student from the Open University program is accepted into a degree program, a maximum of 16 units may apply toward the degree (if the courses are in the same discipline to which the student is accepted). The general GRE test requirement for admission to the master’s degree program will be waived if the student has completed a set of required courses in the department to which they are applying, and has earned a GPA of 3.5 or higher. Open University students who wish to pursue a M.S. degree must submit an online application. Open University students who are considering enrolling in the master’s program should be aware that each specialization has its own set of requirements, and that the number of “free electives” is very limited. Such students are therefore strongly encouraged to choose their classes in consultation with a faculty advisor from the very beginning. Students should remember, however, that all coursework taken at SCU, whether as a degree-seeking or an Open University student, becomes a part of the student’s academic history. Please Note: Santa Clara University does not issue F-1 visas to applicants who wish to enter directly into the open university program.

If the amount in question is found to be correct, payment must be submitted to the Bursar’s Office immediately upon notification. REFUND PAYMENTS Refunds will be processed only for student accounts reflecting a credit balance. The refund request process will begin after the end of the late registration period. A refund will not be processed based on anticipated aid. All financial aid must be disbursed into a student’s account before a refund is processed. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that all necessary documentation is completed and submitted to the Financial Aid office so that aid can be disbursed properly and in a timely fashion. Payment received by personal check will have a 14-calendar day hold before a refund can be issued; electronic check payments require a 7-day hold. Credits from overpayments on student accounts will remain on the account for future charges or refunded to the original payer. Payments by wire transfer will be returned via the same method. For information on the Tuition Refund process and policies, please visit the Bursar’s Office website: REFUNDS Fall, Winter, and Spring Quarters Graduate students who drop courses or formally withdraw from the University during fall, winter, or spring term will receive a tuition refund in accordance with the following: By the end of the first week of classes – 100% tuition refund, less any applicable fees By the end of the second week of classes – 50% tuition refund, less any applicable fees By the end of the third week of classes – 25% tuition refund, less any applicable fees After the third week of classes – zero tuition refund Summer Students who drop courses or withdraw from the University during the summer session term will receive a tuition refund in accordance with the following: By the end of day of the second scheduled class meeting – 100% tuition refund, less any applicable fees By the end of day of the third scheduled class meeting – 50% tuition refund, less any applicable fees No tuition refund after these days Courses taught in an asynchronous manner meet M, W, R for tuition refund purposes. Saturday/Sunday Courses/Off Cycle Courses Students enrolled in a weekend course in which the first class meeting is after the first week of the term must provide written notification, to the Graduate Programs Office, of their intent to withdraw or drop any weekend/off cycle course(s). Failure to comply with this process will result in a forfeit of tuition.

Students will receive a 50% tuition refund, less any applicable fees, if written notification is received by 5 p.m. on the Tuesday immediately following the second-class meeting. To receive tuition refunds from the Bursar’s Office, course drops must be handled administratively. Students should NOT drop a weekend/off cycle course themselves through eCampus after the first week of the quarter. Please Note: If you withdraw or drop below half-time status you may no longer be eligible to receive financial aid or student loans. Your account will be adjusted accordingly, and the aid returned to the appropriate program. If you have received a refund for these funds, you must reimburse Santa Clara University immediately. For more information on financial aid forfeiture, please visit the Financial Aid website or make an appointment with your financial aid counselor. One-Unit Courses Students enrolled in a one-unit course must provide written notification to their respective Records Office of their intent to withdraw or drop any course(s). Failure to comply with this process will result in a forfeit of tuition. The following refund schedule applies: Students will receive a 100% tuition refund, less any applicable fees, if written notification is received within two business days prior to the first-class meeting. Students will receive a 50% tuition refund, less any applicable fees, after the first-class meeting unless the course has only one session, in which case no refund will be granted. Financial Hardship Students who withdraw from the University or drop courses due to an illness, injury, or psychological/emotional condition are eligible for a tuition refund in accordance with the schedule above. Tuition insurance may be purchased to cover tuition charges for medically related withdrawals that occur after the first week of the term. Santa Clara University degree students who withdraw from the University or who are administratively withdrawn from the University after the third week of the term due to a qualifying financial hardship may be eligible for an allocation from the student hardship fund for 25 percent of the tuition charges for that term. Qualifying financial hardships include (1) death, disabling injury, medical emergency, (2) loss of job by an independent student, (3) medical or other emergency involving a dependent of an independent student, and (4) student deployment for active military duty. The Vice Provost for Student Life or designee, in consultation with the Financial Aid Office, will determine qualifying financial hardships and any allocation from the student hardship fund. Students must submit a request for an allocation from the student hardship fund by the end of the applicable term. Santa Clara reserves the right to change tuition, room and board, fees, or other costs, to modify its services, or change its programs at any time. In addition, no refunds of tuition, room and board, fees or other costs will be made because of curtailed services resulting from strikes, acts of God, civil insurrection, riots or threats thereof, changed economic conditions, national emergency, or other causes beyond the control of Santa Clara University. TUITION INSURANCE PROTECTION Students and families may protect themselves against financial loss from an unexpected withdrawal from the University by purchasing tuition insurance coverage. The University has partnered with A.W.G. Dewar Inc., to provide an optional insurance plan. This plan is designed to protect from loss of funds paid for tuition should it be necessary to completely withdraw from the University during the term for diagnosed medical or mental health reasons. Information on the tuition insurance plan can be found at:www.collegerefund.com and available on the Bursar’s Office website at: www.scu.edu/bursar/tuitionprotection. FINANCIAL AID Students must be enrolled at least part-time status (4 units) to receive Federal financial aid. California State Graduate Fellowships State graduate fellowships are awarded to California residents pursuing a recognized graduate or professional degree who intend to pursue teaching as a career and who have not completed more than four quarters of full-time graduate work as of October 1. Selection is based on state manpower needs, academic performance, and financial need. Applicants should apply using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is available at the website: www.fafsa.ed.gov/. Loans Students applying for aid may find the most advantageous method of financing their education through loan programs. Among those available to students of the School of Engineering are the Federal Perkins Loan and Federal Stafford Loans through the School as Lender Program. Applicants should apply using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is available at the website: www.fafsa.ed.gov/. Please Note: A student must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen to qualify for federal sources of financial assistance. Deadlines The Financial Aid Office has established deadlines for consideration of the various programs it administers. All students requesting financial aid from the University should contact the Financial Aid Office at the earliest possible date to request specific deadline information and appropriate application materials. Files completed later than February 1 for new recipients and March 2 for current recipients will receive consideration on a funds-available basis. All financial aid deadlines are posted on the Financial Aid website: www.scu.edu/financialaid. Veterans and Veterans' Dependents Assistance Santa Clara University has been certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 percent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill®), Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®), and Yellow Ribbon. Individuals interested in attending under any of the veteran assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University's Office of the Registrar registrar@scu.edu. GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill. Teaching and Research Assistantships The School of Engineering offers a limited number of teaching and research assistantships providing up to eight units of tuition and, in some cases, a modest stipend. For further information, students are encouraged to contact their faculty advisor or their academic department. University-Awarded Aid Individual graduate schools may grant their students a specific amount of financial aid, per term, in the form of Santa Clara University school scholarships. Once the amount has been determined by the school, the information is sent to the Financial Aid Office for processing. The Financial Aid Office awards the aid and sends an email notification to the student’s SCU Gmail address only, informing them of their financial aid package and/or any aid revision. Students will be able to see their school scholarship award on e-campus. The award amount will also appear as “anticipated aid” on the student’s account to alleviate the assessment of holds/late fees from the Bursar’s Office. Generally, financial aid is disbursed to the student’s account ten days before the start of classes each term. If eligible, the Bursar’s Office will issue refunds to students reflecting credit balances after the first week of class. Cancellation of Financial Aid and Return of Funds Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are subject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal financial aid funds governed under Title IV. Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to the state or University financial aid programs and/or the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received federal Title IV assistance: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans) Subsidized Federal Direct Loans Federal Direct Grad PLUS Loans Federal PELL Grants for which a return is required Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants for which a return is required TEACH Grants for which a return is required Iraq and Afghanistan Grants for which a return is required "},"chapter-5-academic-information.html":{"url":"chapter-5-academic-information.html","title":"Chapter 5: Academic Information","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 5: Academic Information Engineering Honor Code The Engineering Honor Code is a long-standing Santa Clara tradition; instituted at the request of engineering students, it states: All students taking courses in the School of Engineering agree, individually and collectively, that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in examinations or other coursework that is to be used by the instructor as the basis of grading. Students and teachers cooperate and share responsibilities under the code. Teachers are responsible for making clear what aid is permissible and for using procedures that minimize temptations to violate the code. Students are responsible for behaving honorably, for actively ensuring that others, as well as themselves, uphold the code, and for being responsive to violations. Alleged violations should be reported to the Office of the Dean. Classes Classes are taught in the following time slots: 7:10-9:00 a.m., 5:10-7:00 p.m., and 7:10-9:00 p.m, Monday through Friday with some Saturday and/or Sunday offerings; two-unit courses meet one day per week, and four-unit courses meet two days per week. All students are expected to attend the first class meeting of the quarter. Failure to do so can result in an administrative withdrawal by the professor of the course during the first week of the quarter. Standards Of Scholarship Only courses in which the student has earned assigned grades of A, B, or C, with plus (+) or minus (-) variations, may be counted for the Master’s or Ph.D. degree. The student must earn a minimum 3.0 cumulative grade point average (GPA) overall, and a minimum 3.0 grade point average (GPA) in their major of the approved minimum 46 units required for the completion of the M.S. degree or the approved minimum 72 units required for the Ph.D. degree. Only credits, not grade points, are transferred from other institutions. Students who have not met the minimum cumulative 3.0 GPA overall for two consecutive active quarters are eligible for dismissal. The student’s advisor and Department Chair will be notified about their GPA status by email. The decision to be dismissed from the program will be based on a departmental vote, which will be conducted at the request of the advisor and/or Department Chair, and with approval from the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs. Students who have been dismissed from the program can appeal to the Department Chair, and subsequently to the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. EMGT Major Note: In addition to the cumulative GPA requirement, Engineering Management students must also maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher in their EMGT and technical stem courses. Note 1: Only classes with assigned grades of C- or higher will count toward the completion of the certificates, M.S., or Ph.D. degrees. The grades of all courses completed during the certificate, M.S. or Ph.D. program are used to compile the final grade point average (GPA). Note 2: Directed Research, Independent Study, and Engr courses will not go toward the student's major GPA. Only major subject courses will be calculated in the students’ major GPA. Grading System The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes, except that the grade of A may not be modified by a (+). Grade point values per unit are assigned as follows: A = 4.0; A- = 3.7; B+ = 3.3; B = 3.0; B- = 2.7; C+ = 2.3; C = 2; C- = 1.7; D+ = 1.3; D = 1.0; D- = 0.7. F= 0. I (incomplete), P (pass), NP (no pass), NS (no show) and W (withdrawn) are all assigned zero points. Unit credit, but not grade point credit, is awarded when the grade of P is assigned. The University also uses the following marks: AUD (audit), I (incomplete), and N (continuing work), . No unit credit or grade point value is granted for any of these marks. Non-graded Courses Courses such as seminars (with the exception of COEN 400 and ELEN 200), Co-ops, etc., are limited to a total of four units and must be approved by the student’s advisor. Incomplete Grades A student’s work may be reported incomplete if, due to illness or other serious circumstance, some essential portion of the coursework remains unfinished after the final examination, or if the thesis has not been completed. An incomplete (I) becomes a failure (F) unless the unfinished work is completed to the satisfaction of the instructor and proper notice is filed with the Office of the Registrar within four weeks from the beginning of the next scheduled quarter, not including summer session. Makeup work must be in the hands of the instructor no later than the end of the third week so that the instructor can meet the four-week submission deadline. An N grade for a thesis course indicates continuing work. A final grade must be submitted before graduation. Auditing Courses A student may take courses with a grading basis of “audit” but needs to keep in mind the following: The current graduate tuition rate of $1088.00 per unit + the $180.00 engineering fee will be charged. No grade points or credit will be earned so the class cannot be counted toward the completion of a certificate, M.S. or Ph.D. A student will need to register for the class, then send an email to the Director of Records requesting that the grading basis be changed to “Audit”: lmjocewicz@scu.edu The last day to request to audit a course is at the end of the first week of the quarter. Alumni students can request to audit a course with a reduced tuition fee. Alumni students will need to apply to the Open University program to enroll in classes as an audit. Please contact the Director of Records for the alumni audit form; lmjocewicz@scu.edu Repeating Courses A student may, with the permission of the department, repeat a course in which a grade of C- or lower was received on the first attempt. All grades, whether received on the first or second attempt, will be used in computing overall student performance. The units from a course may be counted only once in fulfilling graduation requirements. Withdrawal From Courses Students may change their course registration as stated in the Academic Calendar. Withdrawal from any course may be accomplished up to the 7th Friday of the term. After the fourth week of the quarter, a withdrawal will be recorded as W on the transcript. After the tenth Friday, an emergency that qualifies may be handled as an incomplete (I). Dropping a course without a formal withdrawal will result in a grade of F. Deadlines are strictly adhered to. There is no tuition refund when a student withdraws from a course if the withdrawal occurs after the tuition refund deadlines listed in the academic calendar. Program Of Studies During the first quarter of enrollment, a student in the M.S. degree program is required to meet with a faculty advisor to complete a Program of Studies (POS) form. The program of studies can be found on our graduate engineering website under current student resources. www.scu.edu/engineering/graduate. Here are assigned advisors for the following departments Aerospace Engineering-Mohammad Ayoubi and Chris Kitts (Program Advisors) Applied Math-Stephen Chiappari (Department Chair) Bioengineering-Please contact the department for available advisors. Civil Engineering-Please contact the department for available advisors. Computer Science and Engineering- The CSE department will email your advisor information by the end of the first week of the quarter. Electrical and Computer Engineering-Please contact the department for available advisors. Engineering Management and Leadership-Paul Semenza (Department Chair) Mechanical Engineering-Please contact the department for available advisors. Power Systems and Sustainable Energy-Maryam Khanabaghi (Program Advisor) Robotics and Automation-Christopher Kitts (Program Advisor) The POS must include all planned courses, units and any transfer credit approved by the department. The POS must be signed by the advisor and submitted to the Engineering Graduate Programs Office before the end of the first quarter of enrollment. Failure to submit a new POS will result in a registration hold. Variations from the approved Program of Studies may be made either with written approval of the advisor or by submitting an updated Program of Studies form with the advisor’s signature to the Engineering Graduate Programs Office. The final Program of Studies form signed by the advisor must include all units and transfer credits, and must be submitted during the student’s final quarter for graduation. Please Note: Extension, online and continuing education units are not accepted for transfer credit. Courses Transferred From Santa Clara University With the approval of their academic advisor, M.S. students who have an undergraduate degree from Santa Clara University can transfer up to 12 units of eligible graduate level coursework into their program. Only those courses completed with a C grade or higher will be eligible for transfer. The units will not transfer if they have been used for another degree. Since these courses were taken at SCU, the grades will count toward the overall grade point average. Courses Transferred From Other Institutions All M.S. students have the option to transfer a maximum of 6 semester or 9 quarter units of graduate level coursework from an accredited institution into their degree program with their advisor’s approval. All Ph.D. students have the option to transfer a maximum of 12 semester or 18 quarter units of graduate level coursework from an accredited institution into their degree program with their advisor’s approval. Please keep the following in mind when transferring units: Only those courses completed with a C grade or higher will be eligible for transfer. Extension, continuing education, and online courses may not be transferred. The units will not transfer if they have been used for another degree. Only the credit will transfer, but not grades; so the overall grade point average will be based on coursework completed at Santa Clara University only. An official transcript and course syllabus is required for verification of the units by the student’s advisor and Engineering Graduate Programs. In order to transfer units into a degree program, please follow this procedure: Include the units you wish to transfer in the “Transfer Credit” section of the Program of Studies form and include the Institution Name, Course Number and Title, Grade, Units*, Year and (if applicable) the SCU equivalent course. If no equivalent course is listed, the transfer credit will be processed as general transfer credit (TRCR 300). (*Note that 1 semester unit is equivalent to 1.5 quarter units. Please put the quarter unit value on the Program of Studies so that the final total will be correct.) The student’s academic advisor must sign the Program of Studies form and submit it to the Engineering Graduate Programs Office. The Graduate Programs Office must have an official transcript from the school you are transferring units from to review and approve the transfer credit request. NOTE: Courses that were taken more than 10 years ago are generally not acceptable for transfer credit. Students who wish to request an exception must petition the department Chair and receive a written approval with a justification. The final approval is given by the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs. Petition For Graduation It is a student’s responsibility to file an online petition for graduation no later than the last day to petition for graduate degrees as indicated in the Academic Calendar. The petition to graduate will only be accepted through online submission and may be found on the graduate engineering website under current student resources www.scu.edu/engineering/gradaute. All graduating students must submit a final program of studies and enroll in at least one unit for their final quarter. Please Note: Eligibility to participate in the June Commencement ceremony will be based on the completion of all requirements and units by the end of the spring quarter or participation in the ceremony will be delayed until the following June. Cooperative Education Option The objective of cooperative education is to provide students with the opportunity, through the interaction of study and work experience, to enhance their academic knowledge, to further their personal work experience, and to learn about working with people. The Cooperative Education option integrates classroom work with practical industrial experience. It alternates or parallels periods of college education with periods of practical training in industry. The industrial training is related to the field of study in which the student is engaged and often is diversified to afford a wide range of experience. To qualify for this study option, students must complete at least 24 graduate level units at Santa Clara University. Please note that COEN 900 level courses and transfer credit do not count toward the 24 graduate level unit requirement. Students who wish to pursue this option through curricular practical training (CPT) must enroll in ENGR 288. This class is a prerequisite for ENGR 289, and must be taken before you begin an internship. To be eligible to enroll in ENGR 288 students must complete at least 16 units of graduate level courses by the end of their second quarter at SCU, or demonstrate that they will complete 24 units of graduate-level coursework by the end of their third quarter with department chair approval. Those who plan to start (or continue) their CPT after they have taken ENGR 288 must enroll in ENGR 289 (which is allowed for credit up to three times).** Students who were authorized for CPT but did not receive a passing grade in ENGR 288 or ENGR 289 will not be eligible for future CPT authorization since they did not complete the academic requirements associated with their internship. ** Note 1: ENGR 288 is not offered in the summer quarter. Students who plan to participate in a summer internship need to enroll in ENGR 288 in the Spring quarter. Concurrent Enrollment Concurrent Enrollment means that a student is enrolled in two places at the same time. An international student at Santa Clara University may be given permission to engage in Concurrent Enrollment provided the student meets the following USCIS requirements: Combined enrollment amounts to a full course of study The student has been granted permission from a faculty advisor to enroll at another college (advisor must sign Concurrent Enrollment Form) Must receive written approval from DSO at International Student Services The student is making normal progress at Santa Clara and is not in danger of probation or disqualification Any NON-vocational coursework from the other school will be accepted for fulfilling degree requirements at SCU For more information, please email the International Student Services Office at iss@scu.edu or refer to website: www.scu.edu/globalengagement/international-students Non-enrollment Period Students in the Master’s and Ph.D. program are expected to enroll in at least one unit for the fall, winter and spring quarters, summer quarter is optional to enroll. Those students who do not wish to enroll must submit a leave of absence or a withdrawal form to the Engineering Graduate Programs Office. A leave of absence form is required if a student plans to miss one or two quarters, while a more prolonged absence requires a withdrawal form. Students who wish to resume their Master’s or Ph.D. studies after a leave of absence or withdrawal from the program must submit a returning student request form. The forms can be found on the graduate engineering website; Current Student Resources. Leave of absence or withdrawal forms must be submitted by the end of the first week of the quarter. Returning student’s request forms must be submitted three weeks prior to the start of the quarter returning. Please note the return request is not guaranteed. M.S. students are required to complete their degree within six years from their original admit term date. The six-year time frame includes quarters during which a student was not enrolled. Ph.D. students are required to complete their degree within eight years from their original admit term date. The eight-year time frame includes quarters during which a student is not enrolled. Certificate students are required to complete their certificate within two years from their original admit term date. Note that students who miss a quarter and fail to submit the appropriate form(s) with the Graduate Programs Office will be automatically discontinued as a no show status and will be required to submit a returning student form. This is the same procedure for students who took a leave of absence or withdrew from the program. Withdrawal From The University Withdrawal from the University is not officially complete until students clear all of their financial obligations with the Bursar’s Office. Students on deferments or a Federal Perkins Loan must also clear their financial obligations with the Credit Counseling Office. Student Records And Release Of Information The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the confidentiality of the University records of Santa Clara University students. A student is any person who attends or has attended a class, which includes courses taken through videoconference, satellite, Internet, or other electronic and telecommunication technologies and for whom the institution maintains education records. The University is authorized under provisions of the Act to release directory information to any person on request, unless a student explicitly requests in writing that the University not do so and keep directory information confidential. A student's directory information is designated as follows: Student's name Address: Campus post office box, local, and permanent addresses (residence hall and room numbers are not disclosed) Telephone number Email address Photograph Date and place of birth Major field of study Classification level/academic standing Dates of attendance (defined as academic year or quarter) Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Weight and height of members of athletic teams Degrees (including expected or actual degree date), honors and awards received, and dates Most recent educational agency or institution attended During the registration period and throughout the academic year, students may request in writing through the Office of the Registrar that directory information be kept confidential. Once filed, the request remains in effect until the beginning of the next academic year or a shorter period if designated by the student. Graduating students must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing to remove the nondisclosure notation from their record. The University is authorized under FERPA to release educational and directory information to appropriate parties without consent if the University finds an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals in light of the information available at the time. Former or current borrowers of funds from any Title IV student loan program should note carefully that requests for nondisclosure of information will not prevent the University from releasing information pertinent to employment, enrollment status, current address, and loan account status to a school lender, subsequent holder, guarantee agency, the United States Department of Education, or an authorized agent. Students have the right to inspect and review their educational records at the following offices: Official academic records, including application forms, admission transcripts, letters of acceptance, and a student's permanent academic record are on file and maintained in the Office of the Registrar and the Graduate Programs Office Records related to a student's nonacademic activities are maintained in the Office of Student Life Records relating to a student's financial status with the University are maintained in the various student financial services offices Certain records are excluded by law from inspection, specifically those created or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist in connection with the treatment or counseling of a student. Parents' financial information, including statements submitted with scholarship applications, is also excluded by law from inspection. Third parties may not have access to educational records or other information pertaining to students without the written consent of the student about whom the information is sought. Students have the right to request the amendment of their educational records to ensure that they are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy or other rights. Students may direct complaints regarding academic records to the dean of the college or school in which they are enrolled or to the University registrar.

John Finnemore, P.E.Associate Professor Emeritus: Steven C. Chiesa, P.E.Robert W. Peters Professor: Edwin Maurer, P.E. (Department Chair)Professors: Aria Amirbahman, Reynaud L. Serrette, Sukhmander Singh, P.E., G.E.Associate Professors: Rachel He, Hisham SaidSenior Lecturer: Tonya Nilsson, P.E.Lecturers: Tracy Abbott, S.E., Laura Doyle Overview The Department of Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering offers graduate programs in the areas of structural engineering, general civil engineering, and construction engineering and management. The focus of the educational effort is on modeling, analysis, and practical methods used to design and construct structures and other civil engineering-related infrastructure systems. As such, many of the courses offered are beneficial to civil and construction engineers, and construction managers interested in advancing their knowledge and enhancing their technical skills. Degree Program The civil, environmental, and sustainable engineering graduate program at Santa Clara University is designed to accommodate the needs of students interested in advanced study. An individual may pursue the degree of Master of Science (M.S.) as either a full-time or part-time student through a customized balance of coursework, design projects, and directed research. Program participants are also required to supplement their technical work with coursework on project management topics addressed in the graduate engineering core curriculum. The structural engineering (SE) track provides students with an opportunity to effectively link theory and practice by completing a combination of analysis- and design-oriented courses. Options within the structural engineering track allow students to either complete a capstone design project or a faculty-directed research investigation. This program track is aimed at individuals looking to prepare for a career in consulting structural engineering or in structural plan review. The general civil engineering (GCE) track has been configured to provide students with additional analytical and design coursework in several infrastructure-related areas of civil engineering. This track could potentially include work in water resources engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering, and geotechnical engineering. A capstone design or research project with a required sustainability component is available to integrate these different elements. This track is geared toward individuals preparing for a career in land development, municipal engineering, or public works. The construction engineering and management (CEM) track is designed to prepare students with skills and knowledge required to effectively manage time, cost, safety, quality, and sustainability requirements of construction projects. The track has some flexibility to accommodate students with interests in practical applications or research investigations. This track is designed for students with career objectives of managing building or substantial construction projects for contractors, owners, and developers. The water and environmental engineering (WEE) track prepares students to engage in advanced engineering analysis, design, and research to solve complex issues by quantifying risks related to water supply, flooding, and contamination and designing systems to treat contamination to protect public health and the environment. This track is ideal for people interested in working on these topics with public agencies, consulting firms, nonprofits, or pursuing further graduate work. Master of Science in Civil Engineering To be considered for admission to the graduate program in Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering, an applicant must meet the requirements outlined in the Admissions section of the bulletin, with the following additional criteria: Applicant’s undergraduate degree must be: A civil engineering B.S. from an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)-accredited four-year program or its equivalent, or A B.S. in a relevant technical area for the proposed graduate track. In such cases, applicants must take sufficient additional courses beyond the 46-unit minimum to ensure coverage of prerequisite material for the required classes. For example, applicants pursuing the water/environmental track would need CENG 41, CENG 141, CENG 143, plus any missing differential equations, physics, and chemistry prerequisites to those. These additional classes are subject to the same grade requirements as described elsewhere in the bulletin. Applicant’s undergraduate record must show: An overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.75 (based on a 4.0 maximum scale). In very rare cases, applicants not meeting this may be admitted with a requirement to successfully complete a defined course of studies within a limited time period. See the Academic Information section of this bulletin for details on transferring credit for courses taken at other institutions. Upon acceptance to the graduate program in Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering, a student will be required to select a graduate advisor (full-time faculty member) from within the Department of Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering. The student’s advisor will be responsible for approving the student’s course of study. Any changes to a student’s initial course of study must have the written approval of the student’s advisor. To qualify for the degree of Master of Science in Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering, the students must complete a minimum of 46 quarter units, including elective and required core courses, within the School of Engineering. Required and elective courses for structural engineering, general civil engineering, and construction management tracks are provided below. Students may elect to do a design project or research project. Students undertaking a design project would investigate applying a new technique or method in the analysis or design of a structure, system, or element, and this must be documented in a design report. Students undertaking a research project would develop a new technique, method, component, or design criteria, and this must be documented in a conference or journal publication, or report.

Eskafi, Keyvan Moataghed, Yuan Wang Overview The most successful graduates in the field of computing are those who understand computers as systems—not just the design of hardware or software, but also the relationships and interdependencies between them and the underlying theory of computation. The Computer Science and Engineering degree includes courses that cover the breadth of the discipline, from the engineering aspects of hardware and software design to the underlying theory of computation. Degree Programs Students are required to meet with their advisors to define and file a program of study during their first quarter. In general, no credit is allowed for courses that duplicate prior coursework, including courses listed as degree requirements. Students should arrange adjustment of these requirements with their academic advisor when they file their program of study. With the prior written consent of the advisor, master’s students may take a maximum of 12 units of coursework for graduate credit from selected senior-level undergraduate courses. Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering (MSCSE) All students admitted to the MSCSE program are expected to already have competence in the fundamental subjects listed below, as required within an accredited program for a B.S. in Computer Science Engineering. An applicant without such background (but who has completed college level calculus and advanced programming) may still be admitted, provided the deficiencies are corrected by coursework that is in addition to the normal degree requirements, and that is completed within the first year of graduate study. Alternatively, a student may take a similar course at another approved accredited institution. Online, continuing education, extension courses, and courses without a closed book exam are not accepted. The subjects and corresponding SCU courses that may be used to correct the deficiencies include: 1) Logic design COEN 21 or 921C 2) Data structures COEN 12 or 912C 3) Computer organization & assembly language COEN 20 or 920C or ELEN 33 4) Discrete math AMTH 240 5) Probability AMTH 210 6) One of the following: Differential Equations (AMTH 106), Numerical Analysis (AMTH 220, 221), or Linear Algebra (AMTH 245, 246) 7) One additional advanced programming course or one year of programming experience in industry. The SCU COEN and ELEN courses listed above and AMTH 106 are considered undergraduate-level and may not be used to satisfy the requirements for the M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. However, students who have not satisfied item 4 above may use AMTH 240 as an elective; students who have not satisfied item 5 above may use AMTH 210 as an elective; students who have satisfied item 6 above, but who have never studied numerical analysis, may use AMTH 220/221 as electives; students who have satisfied item 6 above, but who have never studied linear algebra, may use AMTH 245/246 as electives. Laboratory components are not required for the above courses. Degree Requirements Engineering Graduate Core- Enrichment Experience.Students must take a minimum of 8 units of the Graduate Core Enrichment Experience. A minimum of 4 units must be from the Graduate Core which requires at least two courses from the three areas Emerging Topics in Engineering, Engineering and Business/Entrepreneurship, Engineering and Society. The remaining 4 units can be accumulated by the following a) Taking one or more major technical electives, b) Taking additional classes from the Graduate Core, c) Taking Cooperative Education course d) Combining courses from a, b and c. Please refer to Chapter 6: Enrichment Experience and Graduate Core for additional information and the core course list. MSCSE Core COEN 210, 279, and 283 Students who have taken one or more of these core courses or their equivalent must replace said course(s) with the advanced course equivalent (COEN 313, 379, and/or 383) or, with their advisor’s approval, replace said course(s) with elective(s). MSCSE Electives A student must take a minimum of 8 units of COEN 300-899 courses. CSE electives must be approved by the advisor. Electives: Sufficient units to bring the total to at least 46. (The minimum number of COEN graduate units should be at least 36 units, and courses must be approved by the advisor.) Please Note: Students wishing to do a thesis (COEN 497) should consult with their academic advisor regarding a modification of these requirements. Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science and Engineering The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is conferred by the School of Engineering primarily in recognition of competence in the subject field and the ability to investigate engineering problems independently, resulting in a new contribution to knowledge in the field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a thesis based on that research, and a program of advanced study in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences. The student’s work is directed by the department, subject to the general supervision of the School of Engineering. See Chapters 2 and 3, Academic Programs and Requirements and Admissions, for details on admission and general degree requirements. The following departmental information augments the general requirements. Preliminary Exam A preliminary written exam is offered at least once per year by the School of Engineering as needed. The purpose is to ascertain the depth and breadth of the student’s preparation and suitability for Ph.D. work. Faculty Advisor The student and his or her advisor jointly develop a complete program of study for research in a particular area. The complete program of study (and any subsequent changes) must be filed with the Engineering Graduate Programs Office and approved by the student’s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that courses taken will be acceptable toward the Ph.D. course requirements. Doctoral Committee After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of which must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members. In addition, acceptance of publications with the student as the primary (first) author is required. More details are described in Chapter 2: Academic Programs and Requirements. Time Limit for Completing Degree All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee and approved by the dean of engineering in consultation with the Graduate Program Leadership Council (GPLC). Engineer’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering The program leading to the engineer’s degree is particularly designed for the education of the practicing engineer. The degree is granted on completion of an approved academic program and a record of acceptable technical achievement in the candidate’s field of engineering. The academic program consists of a minimum of 46 units beyond the master’s degree. Courses are selected to advance competence in specific areas relating to the engineering professional’s work. Evidence of technical achievement must include a paper principally written by the candidate and accepted for publication by a recognized engineering journal prior to the granting of the degree. A letter from the journal accepting the paper must be submitted to the department chairperson. In certain cases, the department may accept publication in the proceedings of an appropriate conference. Admission to the program will generally be granted to those students who demonstrate superior ability in meeting the requirements for their master’s degree. Normally, the master’s degree is earned in the same field as that in which the engineer’s degree is sought. Students who have earned a master’s degree from Santa Clara University must file a new application (by the deadline) to continue work toward the engineer’s degree. A program of study for the engineer’s degree should be developed with the assistance of an advisor and submitted during the first term of enrollment.

Overview The field of electrical and computer engineering covers the design, construction, testing, and operation of electrical components, circuits, and systems. Electrical and computer engineers work with information representation, processing and transmission; advancing integrated circuit design for digital, analog, and mixed signals systems; designing and characterizing antennas, RF, microwave and millimeter-wave Systems; new devices and architectures, energy systems and renewable energy; nanotechnology; and all the areas of information circuits and systems that have traditionally supported these efforts. This includes all phases of the digital or analog transmission of information, such as in mobile communications and networks, radio, television, telephone systems, fiber optics, and satellite communications, as well as control and robotics, electric power, information processing and storage. The Electrical and Computer Engineering Programs are supported by the facilities of the University’s Academic Computing Center, as well as by the Engineering Computing Center. The department supports 10 major teaching and research laboratories, five additional laboratories used only for teaching, and a laboratory dedicated to the support of design projects. The five teaching laboratories cover the fields of digital systems, electric circuits, electronics, systems, and RF and communication. Master’s Degree Program And Requirements The master’s degree will be granted to degree candidates who complete a program of studies approved by a faculty advisor. The degree does not require a thesis, but students may include a thesis in their program with up to nine units for their thesis work. The program must consist of no less than 46 units. In addition, a 3.0 cumulative GPA (B average) must be earned in all coursework taken at Santa Clara University. Residence requirements are met by completing no less than 37 units of the graduate program at Santa Clara University. A maximum of nine quarter units (six-semester units) of graduate-level coursework may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor. All units applied toward the degree, including those transferred from other institutions, must be earned within six years from initial enrollment. Students must develop a program of studies with an academic advisor and file the approved program during their first term of enrollment at Santa Clara University. The program of studies must contain a minimum of 46 units of graduate-level engineering courses which include at least 27 units of courses offered within the electrical and computer department and no more than four units of engineering management courses. The program of studies must include the following: Graduate Core-Enrichment Experience (minimum 8 units): Students must take a minimum of 8 units of the Graduate Core Enrichment Experience. A minimum of 4 units must be from the Graduate Core which requires at least two courses from the three areas Emerging Topics in Engineering, Engineering and Business/Entrepreneurship, Engineering and Society). The remaining 4 units can be accumulated by the following a) Taking one or more major technical electives, b)Taking additional classes from the Graduate Core, c) Taking Cooperative Education course d) combining courses from a, b and c. For additional information please see Chapter 6: Enrichment Experience and Graduate Core Requirements. Applied Mathematics (4 units) Electrical and Computer Engineering primary focus area (minimum 6 units). Students must select and meet the requirements of one of the six focus areas listed below. Power Systems and Control Either (236 or 281A) and two courses selected from (211, 232, 281B, 333) IC Design and Technology Three courses selected from (252, 261, 270, 387) RF and Applied Electromagnetics 201 and two courses selected from (202, 203, 204, 624, 701, 706) Signal Processing and Machine Learning 233 and two courses selected from (234, 421, 431, 520, 640, 644) Digital Systems 501 , 511, and 603 Communications 241 and 243, and one course selected from (244, 444, 446) Electrical and Computer Engineering breadth: (minimum 4 units) Two other focus areas must be selected as breadth areas. For each breadth area, one course must be taken from the list of required courses for that area. Additional graduate courses recommended and approved by the graduate program advisor. These M.S. degree requirements may be adjusted by the advisor based on the student’s previous graduate work. An advisor may approve selected undergraduate classes that do not duplicate course content of graduate courses in the program of studies. No more than 15 units of electives may be selected from the following upper-division undergraduate courses: 105, 112, 116, 117, 118, 130, 133, 141, 144, 151, 152, 156, 160, 164, 183 and 184. Alterations in the approved program, consistent with the above departmental requirements, may be requested at any time by a petition initiated by the student and approved by the advisor. Students with relevant technical backgrounds may be admitted to the master’s program without an undergraduate degree in electrical or electrical and computer engineering from an accredited program. In order to guarantee prerequisites for graduate courses, those students must take sufficient additional courses beyond the 46-unit minimum to ensure coverage of all areas of the undergraduate EE core requirements. A student who has earned a Fundamentals of Electrical and Computer Engineering Certificate will have satisfied these background requirements. Undergraduate Core Courses ELEN 21 Introduction to Logic Design ELEN 50 Electric Circuits I ELEN 100 Electric Circuits II ELEN 115 Electronic Circuits I ELEN 120 Microprocessor System Design The advisor will determine which courses must be taken to meet these requirements. Undergraduate core courses will not be included in the 46 units required for the master’s degree. Please Note: In general, no credit will be allowed for courses that duplicate prior coursework, including courses listed above as degree requirements. (However, graduate-level treatment of a topic is more advanced than an undergraduate course with a similar title.) Students should discuss any adjustments of these requirements with their academic advisor before filing their program of studies. In all cases, prerequisite requirements should be interpreted to mean the course specified or an equivalent course taken elsewhere. Engineer’s Degree Program And Requirements The program leading to the Engineer’s Degree is particularly designed for the education of the practicing engineer. The degree is granted on completion of an approved academic program and a record of acceptable technical achievement in the candidate’s field of engineering. The academic program consists of a minimum of 46 quarter units beyond the master’s degree. Courses are selected to advance competence in specific areas relating to the engineering professional’s work. Evidence of technical achievement must include a paper principally written by the candidate and accepted for publication by a recognized engineering journal prior to the granting of the degree. A letter from the journal accepting the paper must be submitted to the department chair. In certain cases, the department may accept publication in the peer-reviewed proceedings of an appropriate national or international conference. Electrical and Computer Engineering courses at the introductory Master of Science level (e.g., ELEN 210, 211, 212, 230, 231, 236, 241, 250, 261; and AMTH 210, 211, 220, 221, 230, 231, 235, 236, 240, 245, 246) are not generally acceptable in an Engineer’s Degree program of studies. However, with the approval of the advisor, the student may include up to three of these courses in the Engineer’s Degree program. The department also requires that at least 15 units of the program of studies be in topics other than the student’s major field of concentration. Candidates admitted to the Electrical and Computer Engineering Program who have M.S. degrees in fields other than electrical and computer engineering must include in their graduate programs (M.S. and Engineer’s Degree combined) a total of at least 46 units of graduate-level electrical and computer engineering coursework approved by an academic advisor. Ph.D. Program And Requirements The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is conferred by the School of Engineering primarily in recognition of competence in the subject field and the ability to investigate engineering problems independently, resulting in a new contribution to knowledge in the field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a thesis based on that research, publication of the research, and a program of advanced studies in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Bioengineering are collaborating to offer a Ph.D. in interdisciplinary topics related to Bioengineering. Faculty from both departments will co-advise the Ph.D. students and the degree will be awarded by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Preliminary Examination The preliminary examination shall be written and shall include subject matter deemed by the major department to represent sufficient preparation in depth and breadth for advanced study in the major. Only those who pass the written examination may take any required oral preliminary examination. Students currently studying at Santa Clara University for a master’s degree who are accepted for the Ph.D. program and who are at an advanced stage of the M.S. program may, with the approval of their academic advisor, take the preliminary examination before completing the M.S. degree requirements. Students who have completed the M.S. degree requirements and have been accepted for the Ph.D. program should take the preliminary examination as soon as possible but not more than two years after beginning the program. Only those students who pass the preliminary examination shall be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. The preliminary examination may be repeated only once, and then only at the discretion of the thesis advisor. General Requirements Thesis Advisor It is the student’s responsibility to obtain consent from a full-time faculty member in the student’s major department to serve as his/her prospective thesis advisor. It is strongly recommended that Ph.D. students find a thesis advisor before taking the preliminary examination. After passing the preliminary examination, Ph.D. students should have a thesis advisor before the beginning of the next quarter following the preliminary examination. Students currently pursuing a master’s degree at the time of their preliminary examination should have a thesis advisor as soon as possible after being accepted as a Ph.D. student. The student and the thesis advisor jointly develop a complete program of studies for research in a particular area. The complete program of studies (and any subsequent changes) must be filed with the Graduate Programs Office and approved by the student’s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that courses taken will be acceptable toward the Ph.D. course requirements. Doctoral Committee After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of whom must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members. Residence The doctoral degree is granted based on achievement, rather than on the accumulation of units of credit. However, the candidate is expected to complete a minimum of 72 quarter units of graduate credit beyond the master’s degree. Of these, 36 quarter units may be earned through coursework and independent study, and 36 through the thesis. All Ph.D. thesis units are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. A maximum of 18 quarter units (12-semester units) may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor. Ph.D. students must undertake a minimum of four consecutive quarters of full-time study at the University; spring and fall quarters are considered consecutive. The residency time shall normally be any period between passing the preliminary examination and completion of the thesis. For this requirement, full-time study is interpreted as a minimum registration of eight units per quarter during the academic year and four units during the summer session. Any variation from this requirement must be approved by the doctoral committee. Comprehensive Examinations and Admission to Candidacy After completion of the formal coursework approved by the doctoral committee, the student shall present his/her research proposal as part of a comprehensive oral examination on the coursework and the subject of his/her research work. The student should make arrangements for the comprehensive examinations through the doctoral committee. A student who passes the comprehensive examinations is considered a degree candidate. The comprehensive examinations typically must be completed within four years from the time the student is admitted to the doctoral program. Comprehensive examinations may be repeated once, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the doctoral committee. Thesis Research and Defense The period following the comprehensive examinations is devoted to research for the thesis, although such research may begin before the examinations are complete. After successfully completing the comprehensive examinations, the student must pass an oral examination on his/her research and thesis, conducted by the doctoral committee and whomever they appoint as examiners. The thesis must be made available to all examiners one month prior to the examination. The oral examination shall consist of a presentation of the results of the thesis and the defense. This examination is open to the public, but only members of the doctoral committee have a vote. Thesis and Publication At least one month before the degree is to be conferred, the candidate must submit to the Office of the Dean of Engineering two copies of the final version of the thesis describing the research in its entirety. The thesis will not be considered as accepted until approved by the doctoral committee and one or more refereed articles based on it are accepted for publication in a first-tier professional or scientific journal approved by the doctoral committee. All doctoral theses must also be archived in the University library. Time Limit for Completing Degree All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. This includes any leave of absences/withdrawals. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee and approved by the Dean of Engineering in consultation with the Graduate Program Leadership Council. (GPLC) Additional Graduation Requirements The requirements for the doctoral degree in the School of Engineering have been made to establish the structure in which the degree may be earned. Upon written approval of the Provost, the Dean of the School of Engineering, the doctoral committee, and the chair of the major department, other degree requirements may be established. The University reserves the right to evaluate the undertakings and the accomplishments of the degree candidate in total, and award or withhold the degree as a result of its deliberations. Certificate Programs General Information Certificate programs are designed to provide an intensive background in a narrow area at the graduate level. At roughly one-third of the units of a master’s degree program, the certificate is designed to be completed in a much shorter period of time. These certificate programs are appropriate for students working in the industry who wish to update their skills or those interested in changing their career path. Students can only take courses that are required for the certificate. Please see Chapter 18 for additional information. Admission To be accepted into a certificate program, the applicant must have a bachelor’s degree and meet any additional requirements for the specific certificate. Exceptions based on work experience may be granted for the Certificate in Fundamentals of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Admitted students are responsible for ensuring that they have the prerequisites for all courses they take in the Certificate Program. Grade Requirements Students must receive a minimum grade of C in each course and have an overall GPA of 3.0 or better to earn a certificate. Continuation for a Master’s Degree All Santa Clara University graduate courses applied to the completion of a certificate program earn graduate credit that may also be applied toward a graduate degree. Students who wish to continue for such a degree must submit a separate application and satisfy all normal admission requirements. The general GRE test requirement for graduate admission to the master’s degree will be waived for students who complete a certificate program with a GPA of 3.5 or higher.

Technical Stem Courses Engineering Management and Leadership students are required to create a focused, coherent program of studies within a field of engineering. The following list areas of focus by department, which can be used as guidelines for developing the Technical Stem program. Bioengineering: Biomolecular Engineering/Biotechnology; Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering; Microfluidics/Biosensors and Imaging; Computational or Translational Bioengineering Civil, Environmental, and Sustainable Engineering: Structural Engineering; General Civil Engineering; Construction Engineering and Management Computer Science and Engineering: Data Science; Internet of Things; Software Engineering; Information Assurance; Multimedia Processing; Computer Networks; Computer Architecture and Systems Electrical and Computer Engineering: Power Systems and Control; RF and Applied Electromagnetics; Signal Processing; Digital Systems; Communications Mechanical Engineering: Aerospace Engineering; Dynamics and Controls; Materials Engineering; Mechanical Design; Robotics and Mechatronic Systems; Thermofluids Power Systems and Sustainable Energy Interdisciplinary Technical Stem programs can be created to pursue areas of interest within engineering management. For example, the following program would be applicable to Industrial Engineering and/or Operations Research. Probabilistic Modeling/Optimization: AMTH 210, 211, 245, 246, 362, 364, 370, 371 (optional: ELEN 235) Mathematical Finance option: substitute AMTH 367 for 2 of the above Network option: substitute ELEN 211 and/or 330 for 1 or 2 of the above Machine Learning option: substitute COEN 240 or 281 for 1 or 2 of the above; or ELEN 520, 521 Courses for the Technical Stem of Engineering Management and Leadership are selected from the graduate course listings in the Graduate Bulletin. However, not all graduate classes listed in the bulletin are considered technical in terms of fulfilling the technical stem requirements. This is especially the case of ENGR courses. In addition, there are other limitations, some of which are listed below. Therefore, it is important that students complete a program of studies in their first term, to make sure all of the courses they select will fulfill the degree requirements. All courses applied to the Engineering Management and Leadership degree must be graded courses—no P/NP courses are allowed. Undergraduate courses cross-listed with graduate course numbers do not apply unless the student registers with the graduate course number. Graduate seminars in other departments such as ELEN 200, COEN 400, MECH 261, MECH 297 are not applicable. COEN 485 Software Engineering Capstone is not applicable to the technical stem unless students complete three one-quarter consecutive sessions beginning in the fall quarter. The following courses do not count toward the technical stem: BIOE 210; CENG 208 and 292; COEN 287 and 288; ELEN 217; ENGR 245, 261, 271, 272, 273, 288, 289, 293, 302, 303, 304, 306, 330, 332, 334, 336, 338, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 349, 350, and 351. Engineering Management and Leadership students are allowed to enroll in one unit of Independent Study or Directed Research under the direction of a full-time faculty member in the respective engineering department. Any additional units will not be counted toward graduation. New courses are often developed and offered during the academic year that are not listed in this bulletin. It is important that students check with their advisor prior to enrolling in those courses to make sure they will count toward their degree. All of the requirements for the engineering management and leadership degree must be completed within a six-year timeframe. In addition to the overall 3.0 GPA graduation requirement, engineering management and leadership degree candidates must earn a 3.0 GPA in those courses applied to their technical stem and a 3.0 GPA in their engineering management course stem. All courses in which a student is enrolled at Santa Clara are included in these calculations. A completed program of studies for Engineering Management and Leadership degree candidates must be submitted to the chair of the Department of Engineering Management and Leadership during the first term of enrollment to ensure that all courses undertaken are applicable to the degree. Students who take courses that have not been approved for their program of studies by both the department chair and the Graduate Programs Office do so at their own risk, as they may not be counted toward completion of the degree. A maximum of nine quarter units (six semester units) of graduate-level coursework may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor provided they have not been applied to a previous degree. However, in no case will the minimum units taken in the Department of Engineering Management and Leadership be fewer than 16. Extension classes, continuing education classes, professional development courses, or classes from international universities are not accepted for transfer credits. Note: International students or students not fluent in the English language should enroll in one or more of the following courses prior to enrolling in advanced courses in engineering management: EMGT 270 Effective Oral Technical Presentations EMGT 272 Effective Written Technical Communications II EMGT 318 Strategies for Career and Academic Success (for foreign-born technical professionals) Engineering Management and Leadership Five-Year Program The School of Engineering offers qualified Santa Clara University undergraduates the opportunity to earn both a Bachelor of Science degree in their technical discipline and a Master of Science degree in Engineering Management and Leadership in five years. This is an excellent path to continue technical education while learning the essential skills required to manage technical projects and people. The degree program is open to students in engineering and engineering physics. The application fee and GRE General Test requirement are waived for students completing their undergraduate B.S. degree in the technical disciplines listed above who have a minimum GPA of 3.0 in their technical major. Students are required to apply no later than the end of their junior year. Upon notification of acceptance into the Engineering Management and Leadership Five-Year Program, students may begin taking graduate-level courses in the fall quarter of their senior year. The maximum number of graduate units allowed to transfer as an undergraduate in this program is 20. Students in this program will receive a B.S. degree after satisfying the standard undergraduate degree requirements. Students will then be matriculated to the Engineering Management and Leadership M.S. program and must then fulfill all requirements for the M.S. degree. Notes B.S. degrees (for those who are graduating seniors) must be posted by September 1 to allow the student progression in their graduate career. Undergraduate students must submit “Permission to Take Graduate Course” form to be correctly registered for graduate courses. All coursework applied to the M.S. degree must be at the 200 level or above and not applied to any other degree. Course numbers below 200 indicate undergraduate courses, numbers of 200 and above indicate graduate courses. Students may take courses assigned both undergraduate and graduate numbers (same title used for both numbers) only once as an undergraduate or graduate student. Students must register with the graduate course number in cross-listed courses to apply the course to an M.S. degree. Students who are entering this program should meet with their Engineering Management and Leadership advisor at the end of their junior year to develop a program of studies to ensure that all graduate courses they plan to take are applicable to the Engineering Management and Leadership M.S. degree.

Preliminary Exam A preliminary written exam is offered at least once per year by the School of Engineering as needed. The purpose is to ascertain the depth and breadth of the student’s preparation and suitability for Ph.D. work. Each student in mechanical engineering must take and pass an exam in mathematics as well as in four areas from the following list: Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Strength of Materials, Dynamics, Design, Controls, Vibrations, Finite Element Analysis, Material Science, and Thermodynamics. The advisor must approve the student’s petition to take the exam. This exam should be taken within one year of starting the program. Doctoral Committee After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of which must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members. Time Limit for Completing Degree All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. This includes leave of absence/withdrawals. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee and approved by the dean of engineering in consultation with the Graduate Program Leadership Council.

Knowledge of this kind has become essential in an increasingly complex and interconnected world, in which purely technical expertise often needs to be supplemented by additional skills. In order to successfully operate in such an environment, engineers must (at the very least) have the ability to communicate clearly, function on interdisciplinary and diverse teams, and make ethically and socially responsible decisions. The need to develop such skills has been widely recognized in universities around the country, as witnessed by the growing emphasis on interdisciplinary studies in undergraduate engineering curricula. It is unusual, however, to encounter programs of this kind on the graduate level. Most traditional master’s programs still focus on specialized technical topics and offer little insight into how practicing engineers might engage global challenges such as climate change, sustainability, or economic disparity (to name just a few). The primary purpose of the STS minor is to offer graduate students an opportunity to examine some of these key social issues on an advanced level. The scope of the minor is broad and includes topics that range from the social impact of new technologies, to applied ethics, sustainability, and religion. As such, it reflects an educational philosophy that goes well beyond narrow specialization and promotes a global and societal orientation. All the courses in this program have a distinctly interdisciplinary flavor, and are designed to develop creativity, innovation, and leadership. The minor consists of a Core and a set of electives and entails a minimum of 12 units of coursework. It is open to all students who are pursuing a master’s degree in engineering, regardless of the specific program in which they are enrolled. Program Requirements The STS minor consists of a Core and a set of electives and entails a minimum of 12 units of coursework. The Core courses cover four distinct thematic areas: • Social and Philosophical Issues in Science and Engineering • Engineering and Ethics • Science and Religion • Sustainability and Engineering Students will be required to take courses in at least three of the Core areas outlined above (for a minimum of 6 units). The remaining units (up to a total of 12, or more if desired) can be accumulated by taking a combination of electives and additional STS Core courses. The courses and the different thematic areas to which they belong are listed below. Note that courses that appear in multiple areas can be used to satisfy only one Core requirement (in other words, no “double dipping” is allowed). Social and Philosophical Issues in Science and Engineering ENGR 261 Nanotechnology and Society ENGR 272 Energy Public Policy ENGR 302 Managing in the Multicultural Environment ENGR 303 Gender and Engineering ENGR 304 Building Global Teams ENGR 336 Engineering for the Developing World ENGR 338 Mobile Applications for Emerging Markets ENGR 341 Innovation, Design and Spirituality ENGR 342 3D Print Technology and Society Engineering and Ethics COEN 288 Software Ethics ENGR 273 Sustainable Energy and Ethics ENGR 310 Engineering Ethics ENGR 334 Energy, Climate Change, and Social Justice Science and Religion ELEN 217 Chaos Theory, Metamathematics and the Limits of Knowledge: A Scientific Perspective on Religion ENGR 334 Energy, Climate Change, and Social Justice ENGR 341 Innovation, Design and Spirituality Sustainability and Engineering ENGR 271 Energy Conservation ENGR 272 Energy Public Policy ENGR 273 Sustainable Energy and Ethics ELEN 280/MECH 287 Introduction to Alternative Energy Systems ELEN 288/COEN 282 Energy Management Systems ENGR 334 Energy, Climate Change, and Social Justice ENGR 337 Sustainability and Green Information Technology ENGR 340 Distributed and Renewable Energy for the Developing World ENGR 349 Topics in Frugal Engineering Admission Procedures The STS minor option is open to all master’s students in the School of Engineering. Those who wish to pursue this minor must submit an application form to the Graduate Services Office by the end of their third quarter at SCU (at the latest), and must have their program of studies approved by the academic advisor for this program (Dr. Aleksander Zecevic). Links to the application form and the program of studies form can be found at the website: www.scu.edu/engineering/graduate Students who complete all the technical requirements set by their department, as well as an approved set of STS classes, will receive a master’s degree with a minor in Science, Technology, and Society. The degree will be conferred by the department to which the student was originally accepted. Please note that the grades obtained in STS courses will be included in the overall GPA and will carry the same weight as grades obtained in technical classes. There are no financial or academic penalties for not completing the minor. Such students will receive the standard master’s degree, with no reference to the STS minor. Financial Aid for the STS Minor Students who have declared a graduate minor in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) are eligible for a special form of financial aid. The amount of aid is limited to 75% of tuition for up to 12 units (excluding fees). These funds can be applied only to courses taken beyond the 45 units that are required for a master’s degree. In order to become eligible for this benefit, students must check the appropriate box that pertains to financial aid on the application form. In addition, their program of studies must be approved by the academic advisor for the program (Dr. Aleksandar Zecevic). Financial aid comes into effect once a student completes 46 units of course work, at which point he or she should follow the procedure outlined below: The quarterly tuition must be paid in full, and in the timeframe specified by the Bursar’s Office. In the second week of each quarter, students must provide the program academic advisor with a list of courses in which they are currently enrolled (this will require official proof of registration). Once the academic advisor establishes that the courses conform to the approved programs of studies (both in the technical and in the STS area), students will receive financial aid in the amount of 75% of their tuition expenses for that quarter (excluding fees). "},"chapter-18-certificate-programs.html":{"url":"chapter-18-certificate-programs.html","title":"Chapter 18: Certificate Programs","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 18: Certificate Programs General Information Certificate programs are designed to provide intensive background in a narrow area at the graduate level. At approximately one-third of the units required for a master’s degree, the certificate is designed to be completed in a much shorter period of time. These certificate programs are appropriate for students working in industry who wish to update their skills or for those interested in changing their career path. Interdisciplinary Certificate in Frugal Innovation Advisor: Dr. Aleksandar Zecevic Over the past two decades, global trends have been forcing businesses to adapt to growing consumer bases in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which are in desperate need of low-cost and high-quality solutions to the challenges that they face. The importance of these new “economic realities” is underscored by the fact that emerging markets are expected to exceed 50% of the world’s GDP in 2017 (according to IMF estimates). In order to excel professionally in such an environment, engineers will have to be equipped with the knowledge and skill sets to appropriately define, design, and implement solutions that are not merely a “stripping down” of Western products to meet the rising demand. Industry, particularly in Silicon Valley, is becoming increasingly aware of this fact and has begun to move toward a ‘Triple Bottom Line’ approach to business, which integrates environmental, societal, and financial considerations. The Certificate in Frugal Innovation is designed to give students the ability and the tools to adapt to this new model, and to expand their understanding of the impact that engineering has on society. This program is suitable for working professionals in a wide variety of engineering disciplines. To enroll, students must have a B.S in Engineering from an accredited institution, and should maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 in order to receive the certificate.

The primary educational objective in supporting student activities and organizations is to foster a community that is enriched by men and women of diverse backgrounds, wherein freedom of inquiry and expression enjoys high priority. The following sections describe various aspects of student life and services. Campus Ministry Campus Ministry is comprised of people who are committed to spiritual and personal growth. Its mission is to foster the spiritual life of our students and Campus Ministry values Gathering across difference, Discerning what is needed, and Transforming our hearts & communities. In support of the University's mission to the \"development of the whole person,\" Campus Ministry offers a variety of programs as well as pastoral presence to support that development, particularly the spiritual and personal aspects. Campus Ministry provides a welcoming environment where faith may be explored, discovered, and developed through worship, retreats, small groups, and conversation. In addition to eight full-time campus ministers, there are also spirituality facilitators who are associated with campus ministry and who live in the university's residence halls. What does Campus Ministry have to offer? Worship: Three Sunday liturgies in the Mission Church, daily noon Mass in the Mission, weekday Misas en español, weekly confession, University celebrations, prayer services, ecumenical (Christian) and interfaith services throughout the year. Intercultural Ministry: Campus Ministry sponsors three faith-based, student-led organizations dedicated to the spiritual wellness of BIPOC students: Beloved Community for Black students, SLC en español for Latinx students, and the API SLC for Asian Pacific Islander students. We also have intercultural celebrations in observance of events such as Día de los Muertos, Simbang Gabi, Las Posadas, la Virgen de Guadalupe, and Lunar New Year, as well as intercultural liturgies for heritage months. Retreats: Santa Clara students are offered a number of retreat experiences over the course of the academic year. Offerings include Search retreats, an Ignatian retreat, and a retreat for first-year students. Retreats are offered to persons of all faiths. Prayer and reflection groups: The Spiritual Life Community program places students in small groups for weekly prayer and reflection. In addition, there are Interfaith Dinner Discussions, weekly Breaking Open the Word (reflection on the lectionary readings), RLC small groups, and outreach to student athletes. Leadership opportunities: Students explore the values of \"servant leadership\" by serving and leading in all program areas, as volunteers, or in one of a number of paid internships. Faith formation: Campus Ministry offers several opportunities for students to learn, reflect, and grow in regard to their faith through Scripture reflection, forums, and presentations. This includes preparation for the sacraments of baptism, first Eucharist, and confirmation in the Catholic Church. Social justice awareness and action: Campus Ministry provides students with a variety of opportunities to live out a faith that does justice. Some key focus areas include participation in the annual Ignatian Family Teach-in for Justice, and community service at a local school. Faith-based clubs: In partnership with the Center for Student Involvement, Campus Ministry aids in the mentoring and support of all faith-based registered student organizations. Sacred spaces: Throughout campus, there are spaces that can be conducive for prayer, meditation, and reflection, such as the Mission Church, the Multifaith Sanctuary in St. Joseph's Hall, or the Meditation Room in Benson. Is Campus Ministry for everyone? Yes! We welcome the participation of anyone interested in spiritual and personal growth, regardless of faith tradition. This is a time for learning about yourself and our world, and we hope we can accompany you in that exploration and deepening of faith and spirituality. Student Media KSCU: KSCU is a student-run, non-commercial radio station at 103.3 FM. The program format features primarily independent music, including indie rock, punk, ska, jazz, blues, electronic, reggae, and more.

"},"chapter-20-student-conduct-code.html":{"url":"chapter-20-student-conduct-code.html","title":"Chapter 20: Student Conduct Code","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 20: Student Conduct Code Statement Of Responsibilities And Standards Of Conduct All members of the University community have a strong responsibility to protect and maintain an academic climate in which the fundamental freedom to learn can be enjoyed by all and where the rights and well-being of all members of the community are protected. To this end, certain basic regulations and policies have been developed to govern the conduct of all students as members of the University community. The Student Handbook is available online at http://www.scu.edu/osl/policies-and-protocols/ Academic Integrity The University is committed to academic excellence and integrity. Santa Clara University Students affirm the following commitment to academic integrity: I am committed to being a person of integrity. I pledge, as a member of the Santa Clara University community, to abide by and uphold the standards of academic integrity contained in the Student Conduct Code. Students are expected to do their own work and to cite any sources they use. Academic dishonesty may include but is not limited to plagiarism (i.e., representing the work or ideas of others as one's own without giving proper acknowledgment), cheating (e.g., copying the work of another person, falsifying laboratory data, sabotaging the work of others), and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context. A student who is guilty of a dishonest act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to and including dismissal from the University, as a result of the student judicial process as described in the Student Handbook and the Academic Integrity Protocol. A student who violates copyright laws, including those covering the copying of software programs, or who knowingly alters official academic records from this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action. Academic Integrity Protocol Allegations within the Context of a Course These procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University community with a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind as described in the Student Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, or the use of prohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allegation of student academic dishonesty. The following describes procedures for resolution by due process. If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolution begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs the student of the suspicion. If the instructor judges on the basis of available evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severity of the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, \"F\" on the particular assignment, or \"F\" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair and the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the matter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom. Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor's decision, the student will contact the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or designated, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department. The department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only role is to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty member from a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the Office of Student Life will arrange for the participation of the student panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair. The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a particular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon a belief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evaluation and therefore will not review the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student. After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of the recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student and the Office of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course. Decisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are intended to be confidential. If the student wishes to withdraw from the course, the instructor's approval is required for the withdrawal process. The instructor may refuse to approve of the withdrawal and may assign an appropriate grade. University Judicial Records Policy When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files. If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the severity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integrity violations. Allegations Outside a Course If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved. "},"chapter-21-university-policies.html":{"url":"chapter-21-university-policies.html","title":"Chapter 21: University Policies","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 21: University Policies Equal Opportunity, Nondiscrimination and Sexual Harassment Policies Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy Santa Clara University is committed to providing an environment free of gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual violence and assault, relationship (dating and domestic) violence, and stalking. The University provides resources and reporting options to students, faculty, and staff to address concerns related to gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct prohibited by Title IX and University policy, and, through training and education, works to prevent its occurrence. The University seeks to provide a consistent, caring, and timely response when sexual and gender-based misconduct occurs within the University community. When the University becomes aware of allegations of sexual misconduct, it will take prompt and effective action. This action may include an initial assessment of safety and well-being, implementing interim remedies at no cost to the complainant for protection and support, discussing how the complainant wishes to proceed, initiating an investigation, and identifying appropriate avenues for resolution. The University's response will be overseen by the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX. The University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy applies to all students, faculty, and staff, and includes any individual regularly or temporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or serving in an official capacity at Santa Clara University (including volunteers and contractors). The policy applies to both on-campus and off-campus conduct and to online actions that have a potential or actual adverse impact on any member of the University community, or which substantially interferes with a person's ability to participate in University activities, or which could affect a substantial University interest or its educational mission. For more information about reporting, response, and adjudication, please see the University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy or contact the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, www.scu.edu/title-ix. NOTE: The Department of Education issued new Title IX regulations to be effective August 14, 2020. The University will update relevant policies and procedures including the Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy to ensure compliance and will post revisions online at www.scu.edu/title-ix. What Constitutes Consent The University adheres to California's definition of affirmative consent for sexual activity. Affirmative consent means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Since individuals may experience the same interaction in different ways, it is the responsibility of each party to determine that the other has consented before engaging in the activity. For consent to be valid, there must be a clear expression in words or actions that the other individual consented to that specific sexual conduct. Reasonable reciprocation can be implied. For example, if someone kisses you, you can kiss them back (if you want to) without the need to explicitly obtain their consent to being kissed back. Consent can also be withdrawn once given, as long as the withdrawal is reasonably and clearly communicated. If consent is withdrawn, that sexual activity should cease. Consent to some sexual contact (such as kissing or fondling) cannot be presumed to be consent for other sexual activity (such as intercourse). A current or previous intimate relationship is not sufficient to constitute consent. Consent is based on the totality of the circumstances evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances, including the context in which the alleged incident occurred and any similar previous patterns that may be evidenced. The question of whether the responding party should have known of the reporting party's incapacity is an objective inquiry as to what a reasonable person, exercising sober judgment, would have known, in the same or similar circumstances. Consent is not voluntary if forced or coerced. Force is the use of physical violence or physical imposition to gain sexual access. Force also includes threats, intimidation (implied threats), and coercion that is intended to overcome resistance or produce consent Coercion is unreasonable pressure for sexual activity. Sexual activity that is forced is, by definition, non-consensual, but non-consensual sexual activity is not necessarily forced. Silence or the absence of resistance alone is not consent. Consent is not demonstrated by the absence of resistance. While resistance is not required or necessary, it is a clear demonstration of non-consent. A person cannot consent if they are unable to understand what is happening, asleep, or unconscious for any reason. A person violates this policy if they engage in sexual activity with someone they know to be, or should know to be, physically or mentally incapacitated. This policy also covers a person whose incapacity results from a temporary or permanent physical or mental health condition, involuntary physical restraint, or the consumption of incapacitating drugs or alcohol. Incapacitation occurs when someone cannot make rational, reasonable decisions because they lack the capacity to give knowing/informed consent (e.g. to understand the \"who, what, when, where, why, or how\" of their sexual interaction). Incapacitation is determined through consideration of all relevant indicators of an individual's state and is not synonymous with (under the) influence, impairment, intoxication, inebriation, blackout, or being drunk. It is not an excuse that the responding party was intoxicated and, therefore, did not realize the incapacity of the reporting party. Reporting Options There are confidential and non-confidential reporting options available. Confidential Resources include on and off campus mental counselors, health service providers, local rape crisis counselors, domestic violence resources, and members of the clergy and chaplains. Confidential on-campus resources include CAPS, Cowell Center, 408-554-4501; Wellness Center, 862 Market Street, 408-554-4409; and members of the clergy or chaplains. Confidential means that what a reporting party shares will not be communicated with anyone else unless except in extreme cases of immediacy of threat or abuse of a minor. Reporting to Law Enforcement For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime of sexual violence, including sexual assault, domestic/dating violence (intimate partner violence), and stalking students, contact the Santa Clara Police Department, dial 911, or contact Campus Safety Services at 408-554-4444. Reporting to the University To report an incident to the University, students may: Report directly to the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX Report online at https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/reporting/ Report anonymously using EthicsPoint at www.scu.edu/hr/quick-links/ethicspoint/ Other campus non-confidential reporting options: Students may report incidents and seek support from other University officials, including: The Office of Student Life, The Office of Residence Life (including Community Facilitators, Resident Directors, Assistant Resident Directors, Neighborhood Representatives, and Assistant Area Coordinators), Spirituality Facilitators, The Office of Housing, Athletics and Recreation, The Center for Student Leadership, The Drahmann Center, Office of Accessible Education (OAE), The Career Center, and Campus Ministry. These University resources are required to report incidents to the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, who will oversee the investigation and resolution process. At the time a report is made, a complainant does not have to decide whether or not to request or participate in an investigation or University resolution process. Notice of Nondiscrimination Santa Clara University's fundamental principles of academic excellence through diversity and inclusion is central to the University's Jesuit, Catholic values, and requires us to provide a workplace and educational environment free from discrimination. In accordance with federal and state law, Santa Clara University does not discriminate and prohibits discrimination against any individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, age, gender, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, registered domestic partner status, veteran or military status, physical or mental disability (including perceived disability), medical condition (including cancer related or genetic characteristics), pregnancy (including childbirth, breastfeeding, and related medical conditions), or other protected classes under the law. This policy therefore affects employment policies and actions, as well as the delivery of educational services at all levels and facilities of the University including in admissions, scholarships and loan programs, athletics, hiring, promotion, job assignment, retention, and compensation. The University will promptly investigate all complaints of protected class discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and related retaliation in accordance with University's Policy on Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct and applicable federal and state laws. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\"), 20 U.S.C. §1681 et seq., is a Federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities. Santa Clara University is committed to providing an environment free from discrimination based on sex and provides a number of resources and services to assist students, faculty, and staff in addressing issues involving sex discrimination. Under Title IX, discrimination on the basis of sex can include sexual harassment or forms of sexual violence, such as rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual exploitation, and stalking also prohibited by University Policy. Inquiries regarding the University's equal opportunity and nondiscrimination policies may be directed to the Director for the Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX who serves as the University's designated Title IX Coordinator and ADA/504 Coordinator, and Affirmative Action Officer.

Drug-free Policies It is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University’s activities. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace even if it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct. The unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and campus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clara premises where the activities of the University are conducted. Violations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. The program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and students. New staff employees are given a copy at New Employee Orientation. New faculty employees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation. The program is reviewed at least biennially by the Office of Student Life, Affirmative Action Office, and the Department of Human Resources. Policy For Withdrawal For Health Reasons Withdrawal for Health Reasons Students may experience an illness, injury, or psychological condition that significantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely in their role as students. In these instances, the Policy for Withdrawal for Health Reasons allows time away from the University for treatment and recovery until functioning is restored to a level that will enable the student to return to the University. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the procedures for student withdrawals from the University for reasons of health and/or safety. The University has designated four categories relating to withdrawal. They differ according to who initiates the action, whether it is voluntary or not, and the re-enrollment procedures. The Vice Provost for Student Life or designee, in consultation with the appropriate mental and medical health professionals and other staff as deemed necessary, is responsible for the implementation of this policy as stated in the Student Handbook.
