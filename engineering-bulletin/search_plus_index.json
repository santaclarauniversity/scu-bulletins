"},"chapter-1-santa-clara-university.html":{"url":"chapter-1-santa-clara-university.html","title":"Chapter 1: Santa Clara University","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 1: Santa Clara University Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Santa Clara University is a comprehensive Jesuit, Catholic university with more than 8,800 students. Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, law, engineering, education, counseling psychology, pastoral ministries, and theology. The University boasts a diverse community of scholars offering a values-oriented curriculum characterized by small class sizes and a dedication to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education--educating the whole person for a life of service--run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs. The University was established as Santa Clara College on the site of the Mission Santa Clara de Asís, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally operated as a preparatory school and did not offer collegiate courses until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. One-third of the students were enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college’s preparatory and high school departments. Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added. In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business opened in 1926, and within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the country to receive national accreditation. For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women wereaccepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admissions explosion—from 1,500students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began the largest building program in school history, building eight residence halls, a student union, and an athletic stadium. In 1985, the University adopted “Santa Clara University” as its official name. University Vision, Mission, And Fundamental Values Santa Clara University has adopted three directional statements to describe the kind of university it aspires to become (Strategic Vision), its core purpose and the constituencies it serves (University Mission), and the beliefs that guide its actions (Fundamental Values). Strategic Vision Santa Clara University will educate citizens and leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion, and cultivate knowledge and faith to build a more humane, just, and sustainable world. University Mission The University pursues its vision by creating an academic community that educates the whole person within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition, making student learning our central focus, continuously improving our curriculum and co-curriculum, strengthening our scholarship and creative work, and serving the communities of which we are a part in Silicon Valley and around the world. Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in aneducational environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creativeimagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institutional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society. We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to thedevelopment of: Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily residential setting Graduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contributions to their fields In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for non-matriculated students. Fundamental Values The University is committed to these core values, which guide us in carrying out our mission and realizing our vision: Academic Excellence. We seek an uncompromising standard of excellence in teaching, learning, creativity, and scholarship within and across disciplines. Search for Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. We prize scholarship and creative work that advance human understanding, improve teaching and learning, and add to the betterment of society by illuminating the most significant problems of the day and exploring the enduring mysteries of life. In this search, our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering. Engaged Learning. We strive to integrate academic reflection and direct experience in the classroom and the community, especially to understand and improve the lives of those with the least education, power, and wealth. Commitment to Students. As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, weendeavor to educate the whole person. We nurture and challenge students--intellectually, spiritually, aesthetically, morally, socially, and physically–-preparing them for leadership and service to the common good in their professional, civic, and personal lives. Service to Others. We promote throughout the University a culture of service—service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its most disadvantaged members as we work with and for others to build a more humane, just, faith-filled, and sustainable world. Community and Diversity. We cherish our diverse and inclusive community of students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni, a community that is enriched by people of different backgrounds, respectful of the dignity of all its members, enlivened by open communication, and caring and just toward others. Jesuit Distinctiveness. We treasure our Jesuit heritage and tradition, which incorporates all of these core values. This tradition gives expression to our Jesuit educational mission and Catholic identity while also welcoming and respecting other religious and philosophical traditions, promoting the dialogue between faith and culture, and valuing opportunities to deepen religious beliefs.

The two departments in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offer credential and graduate programs. The Department of Education focuses on preparing teachers and administrators for public and Catholic schools. It offers programs in teacher preparation leading to credentials (e.g., California preliminary multiple-subject and single-subject teaching credentials, and California Clear credential) and the master of arts in teaching (MAT) degree. Its programs in educational administration prepare public K–12 administrators for credentials (e.g.,the Preliminary California Administrative Services credential and the California Clear Administrative Services credential), and Catholic school leaders through the certificate program in Catholic School Leadership. The department also offers an M.A. program in interdisciplinary education (with emphases in curriculum and instruction; science, technology, environmental education, and mathematics [STEEM]; and educational administration). The departments of Education and Counseling Psychology jointly offer the certificate program in Alternative and Correctional Education. The Department of Counseling Psychology offers two degree programs: M.A. in counseling psychology and M.A. in counseling. The M.A. in counseling psychology can lead to state licensure for marriage and family therapists and/or licensed professional clinical counselors. The department includes emphasis programs in health, correctional, and Latinx counseling. The Jesuit School of Theology (JST) is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the United States operated by the Society of Jesus, as the order of Catholic priests is known. It is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the country that offer three ecclesiastical degrees certified by the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education, and it also offers four advanced theological degrees certified by the Association of Theological Schools. In addition, JST offers a spiritual renewal program for clergy, religious, and lay people, and conducts an annual Instituto Hispano that offers a certificate program to advance Hispanic leadership in the pastoral life of the church. Centers of Distinction Santa Clara University has three Centers of Distinction that serve as major points of interaction between the University and local and global communities. Each center focuses on a theme that is central to Santa Clara’s distinctive mission as a Jesuit university and offers an educational environment integrating rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. Each center engages faculty and students from different disciplines as well as experts and leaders from the community through speakers, conferences, workshops, and experiential learning opportunities. Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship The mission of the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship is to accelerate global, innovation-based entrepreneurship in service to humanity.

As a Center of Distinction at Santa Clara University, the Center leverages its programs to inspire faculty and students with real-world case studies, distinctive curricula, and unique research opportunities, advancing the University's vision of creating a more just, humane, and sustainable world. More information can be found at the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship website. Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education The Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education promotes and enhances the distinctively Jesuit, Catholic tradition of education at Santa Clara University, with a view toward serving students, faculty, staff, and through them the larger community, both local and global. The Ignatian Center achieves this mission chiefly through four signature programs: Bannan Institutes provide yearlong thematic programs including academic events and scholarly activities that further the Jesuit, Catholic character of the University. Community-based learning places over 1,200 students each year with community partners, frequently in connection with an academic course. Immersion programs offer students, during academic breaks, the opportunity to experience local, domestic, and international communities with little access to wealth, power, and privilege. Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius provide opportunities for members of the community to encounter the spiritual sources of the Jesuit tradition. Through these four programs, the Ignatian Center aspires to be recognized throughout Silicon Valley and beyond as providing leadership for the integration of faith, justice, and the intellectual life. Markkula Center for Applied Ethics The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics brings the traditions of ethical thinking to bear on real-world problems. Our mission is to engage individuals and organizations in making choices that respect and care for others. Beyond a full range of events, grants, and fellowships for the Santa Clara University community, the Center serves professionals in business, education, health care, government, journalism, and the social sector--providing training, programs, and roundtables that explore the ethical challenges in the field. Inaddition, we focus on ethical issues in leadership, technology, and the internet. Through our website and international collaborations, we also bring ethical decision-makingresources to the wider world. Faculty Santa Clara University’s emphasis on a community of scholars and integrated education attracts faculty members who are as committed to students’ intellectual and moraldevelopment as they are to pursuing their own scholarship. The University’s 568 full-time faculty members are distinguished teachers and scholars. Examples of awards received by SCU faculty include: Fulbright, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and National Endowment for the Arts. Additionally, our faculty are acclaimed authors, scientists and theorists in their fields. Alumni Santa Clara University has over 96,120 alumni living in all 50 states and almost 100 countries. More than half of the alumni live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many are leaders in business, law, engineering, academia, and public service. Campus The University is located on a 106-acre campus in the city of Santa Clara near the southern end of the San Francisco Bay in one of the world’s great cultural centers. More than 50 buildings on campus house 15 student residences, a main library, a law library, two student centers, the de Saisset Museum, extensive performing arts and athletic facilities, and a recreation and fitness center. Santa Clara’s campus has the advantage of being located in Silicon Valley—a region known for its extraordinary visionaries, who have designed and created some of the most significant scientific and technological advances of our age. Silicon Valley is more than a location—it is a mindset and home to more than three million residents and 6,600 science- and technology-related companies, (not including San Francisco, which is located just an hour away). Santa Clara’s campus is well known for its beauty and Mission-style architecture. Opened in 2013, the brick-paved Abby Sobrato Mall leads visitors from the University’s main entrance to the heart of campus—the Mission Santa Clara de Asís. The rose gardens and palm and olive trees of the Mission Gardens surround the historic Mission Church, which was restored in 1928. The adjacent Adobe Lodge is the oldest building on campus. In 1981, it was restored to its 1822 decor. Academic Facilities Amid all this beauty and history are modern, world-class academic facilities. Students study and thrive in places such as the Joanne E. Harrington Learning Commons, Sobrato Family Technology Center and Orradre Library where individuals and groups can study in an inviting, light-filled, and open environment. Notably, the library features an Automated Retrieval System, a high-density storage area where up to 900,000 books and other publications can be stored and retrieved using robotic-assisted technology. Another example of Santa Clara’s excellent academic facilities is Lucas Hall, home of the Leavey School of Business. This modern 85,000-square-foot building houses classrooms, meeting rooms, offices, study spaces, and a café. Classrooms are equipped with state-of-the-art videoconferencing equipment as well as a multiplatform system to record faculty lectures for later review by students. Vari Hall (formerly Arts and Sciences) adjacent to Lucas Hall is home to the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics as well as academic departments, classrooms, and a 2,200-square-foot digital television studio—among the best found on any campus nationwide. Located near Varsi Hall is the Schott Admission and Enrollment Services Building, a welcome center for campus visitors and home to several University departments. Opened in 2012, the lobby of this green-certified structure includes technology-infused exhibits that illustrate Santa Clara’s Jesuit mission. Among other green features on campus are two solar-powered houses built in 2007 and 2009 for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Decathlon. Both homes now serve as laboratories for solar and sustainability technologies. Student Life The Robert F. Benson Memorial Center serves as a hub for campus life. The Benson Center offers dining services and houses the campus bookstore, post office, and meeting rooms. The University’s main dining hall, The Marketplace, resembles an upscale food court with numerous stations and options. For a more informal experience, The Bronco is the Benson Center’s late-night venue, serving beverages and pub-style food. Another hotspot for student life, the Paul L. Locatelli, S.J., Student Activity Center includes a 6,000-square-foot gathering hall with a high ceiling that can accommodate dances and concerts as well as pre- and post-game activities. Designed with environmental sensitivity, the building is energy efficient and has daytime lighting controls and motion sensors to maximize use of natural light. For fitness-minded students, the Pat Malley Fitness and Recreation Center features a 9,500-square-foot weight training and cardiovascular exercise room, three basketball courts, a swimming pool, and other facilities to support the recreational and fitness needs of the campus community. The campus features many locations for quiet reflection as well, such as the St. Clare Garden, which features plants and flowers arranged into five groups to portray the stages of the saint’s life. For campus members who want a more hands-on relationship with nature, the Forge Garden, SCU’s half-acre organic garden, serves as a campus space for course research, service learning, and sustainable food production. Athletics and The Arts The importance of athletics to the University is evident everywhere on campus. Among the newest additions to Santa Clara's athletics facilities are the Stephen Schott Stadium, home field for the men's baseball team, and the state-of-the-art Stevens Soccer Training Center, funded by a gift from Mary and Mark Stevens. The gift also allowed Santa Clara to upgrade the stands in Stevens Stadium (formerly Buck Shaw Stadium), home to the men's and women's soccer programs, and build a plaza to celebrate Bronco sports---its past, present, and future. The plaza celebrates the history of Santa Clara University football as well as the legacy and future of men's and women's soccer at SCU. Bellomy Field, eight acres of well-lit and grassy playing fields, provides space for club and intramural sports, such as rugby and field hockey. Adjacent to Bellomy Field is the well-appointed women's softball field, which opened in 2013. The Leavey Event Center houses the University's premier basketball facility. Over the years, the Leavey Event Center has hosted nine West Coast Conference Basketball Championships. The University recognizes the arts as an important part of life at Santa Clara University. The Edward M. Dowd Art and Art History Building opened in 2016, housing an integrated fine arts program that is a destination and a center for inspiration, innovation, and engagement in the arts and art history in Silicon Valley. The de Saisset Museum, the University's accredited museum of art and history, presents changing art exhibitions throughout the year and serves as the caretaker of the University's California History Collection, which includes artifacts from the Native American, Mission, and early Santa Clara College periods. SCU•Presents represents the University's commitment to the performing arts on campus, which includes performances at venues such as the Louis B. Mayer Theatre, the Fess Parker Studio Theatre, and the Music Recital Hall. The Mayer Theatre is Santa Clara University's premier theatrical venue, housing 500 intimate seats in either a flexible proscenium or thrust-stage setting. The Fess Parker Studio Theatre has no fixed stage or seating. Its black box design, complete with movable catwalks, provides flexibility in an experimental setting. The 250-seat Music Recital Hall provides a contemporary setting where students, faculty, and guest artists offer a variety of performances.

Master Of Science Program The master’s program is designed to extend the technical breadth and depth of an engineer’s knowledge. Students in this program complete a program of studies approved by the faculty advisor in the major department. The program must include no less than 46 quarter units, and a 3.0 GPA (B average) must be earned in all coursework taken at Santa Clara. Residence requirements of the University are met by completing 36 quarter units of the graduate program at Santa Clara. A maximum of 9 quarter units (6 semester units) of graduate-level coursework may be transferred from other accredited institutions that have not been applied to a previous degree at the discretion of the student’s advisor. All units applied toward the degree, including those transferred from other institutions, must be earned within a six-year period. Students have the option to write a thesis as part of their master’s degree. Students who choose this option are responsible for obtaining an advisor for their thesis work. The maximum number of units awarded for the master’s thesis is nine. Please note that the thesis option is not available in Engineering Management. The School of Engineering offers Master’s programs in Applied Mathematics, Aerospace Engineering, Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Software Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Engineering Management and Leadership, Mechanical Engineering, and Power Systems and Sustainable Energy. The coursework requirements for the degree are determined by each of the major departments. In order to graduate, students must complete the required coursework for the program to which they are admitted and must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 in all coursework listed on their approved program of study. In addition to this requirement, Engineering Management and Leadership degree candidates must earn a 3.0 GPA in those courses applied to their technical stem and a 3.0 GPA in their engineering management course stem. Please note: Only classes with assigned grades of C- or higher will count toward the completion of the certificates, M.S., or Ph.D. degrees. The grades of all courses completed during the M.S., Ph.D. or certificate program are used to compile final cumulative grade point average (GPA) Note that the number of engineering management courses accepted for other degrees in the graduate engineering program is restricted to six units in computer science engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and most options of mechanical engineering. Graduate Minor In Science, Technology, And Society (STS) The graduate minor in science, technology, and society (STS) is designed to help students gain a deeper understanding of the influence that engineering has on society (and vice versa). Knowledge of this kind has become essential in an increasingly complex and interconnected world, in which purely technical expertise often needs to be supplemented by additional skills. In order to successfully operate in such an environment, engineers must (at the very least) have the ability to communicate clearly, function on interdisciplinary and diverse teams, and make ethically and socially responsible decisions. The minor consists of a Core and a set of electives and entails a minimum of 12 units of coursework. It is open to all students who are pursuing a master’s degree in engineering, regardless of the specific program in which they are enrolled. For more comprehensive information, please see Chapter 6. Engineer’s Degree Program The program leading to the engineer’s degree is particularly designed for the education of the practicing engineer. It is offered in the computer science and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering departments. The degree is granted on completion of an approved academic program and a record of acceptable technical achievement in the student’s field of engineering. The academic program consists of a minimum of 46 quarter units beyond the master’s degree. Courses are selected to advance competence in specific areas relating to the engineering professional’s work. Evidence of technical achievement must include a paper principally written by the student and accepted for publication by a recognized engineering journal prior to the granting of the degree. A letter from the journal accepting the paper must be submitted to the department chairperson. In certain cases, the department may accept publication in the proceedings of an appropriate conference. Admission to the program will generally be granted to those students who demonstrate superior ability in meeting the requirements for their master’s degree. Normally, the master’s degree is earned in the same field as that in which the engineer’s degree is sought. Students who have earned a master’s degree from Santa Clara University must file a new application (by the deadline) to continue work toward the engineer’s degree. A program of studies for the engineer’s degree should be developed with the assistance of an advisor and submitted during the first term of enrollment. Doctor Of Philosophy Program The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is sought by those engineers who wish to become experts in a specific area within their field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a thesis based on that research, and a program of advanced studies in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences. The student’s work is directed by the degree-conferring department, subject to the general supervision of the School of Engineering. The school grants the Ph.D. in computer science and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. Preliminary Examination The preliminary examination shall be written and/or oral and shall include subject matter deemed by the major department to represent sufficient preparation in depth and breadth for advanced study in the major. Students currently studying at Santa Clara University for a master’s degree who are accepted for the Ph.D. program and who are at an advanced stage of the M.S. program may, with the approval of their academic advisor, take the preliminary examination before completing the M.S. degree requirements. Students who have completed the M.S. degree requirements and have been accepted for the Ph.D. program should take the preliminary examination as soon as possible but not more than one and one-half years after beginning the program. Only those students who pass the preliminary examination shall be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. The preliminary examination may be repeated only once and only at the discretion of the thesis advisor. Thesis Advisor It is the student’s responsibility to obtain consent from a full-time faculty member in the student’s major department to serve as his/her prospective thesis advisor. It is strongly recommended that Ph.D. students find a thesis advisor before taking the preliminary examination. After passing the preliminary examination, Ph.D. students should have a thesis advisor before the beginning of the next quarter following the preliminary examination. Students currently pursuing a master’s degree at the time of their preliminary examination should have a thesis advisor as soon as possible after being accepted as a Ph.D. student. The student and the thesis advisor jointly develop a complete program of studies forresearch in a particular area. The complete program of studies (and any subsequent changes) must be filed with Engineering Graduate Programs and approved by the student’s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that courses taken will be counted toward the Ph.D. course requirements. Doctoral Committee After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of which must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members. Residence The Ph.D. degree is granted on the basis of academic achievement. The student is expected to complete a minimum of 72 units of graduate credit beyond the master’s degree with an overall GPA of 3.0 or better. Please note: Only classes with assigned grades of C- or higher will count toward the completion of the certificates, M.S., or Ph.D. degrees. Of these, 36 quarter units may be earned through coursework, independent study and directed research, and 36 through the thesis. Deviation from this distribution must be approved by the student’s doctoral committee and must not be more than six units. All Ph.D. thesis units are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. A maximum of 18 quarter units (12 semester units), not previously used for the completion of another degree, may be transferred from any accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor. Comprehensive Examinations and Admission to Candidacy After completion of the formal coursework approved by the doctoral committee, the student shall present his/her research proposal for comprehensive oral examinations on the subject of his/her research work. The student should make arrangements for the comprehensive examinations through the doctoral committee. A student who passes the comprehensive examinations is considered a degree candidate. The comprehensive examinations normally must be completed within four years from the time the student is admitted to the doctoral program. These examinations may be repeated once, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the doctoral committee. Thesis Research and Defense The period following the comprehensive examinations is devoted to research for the thesis, although such research may begin before the examinations are complete. After successfully completing the comprehensive examinations, the student must pass an oral examination on his/her research, conducted by the doctoral committee and whomever they appoint as examiners. The thesis must be made available to all examiners one month prior to the examination. The oral examination shall consist of a presentation of the results of the thesis and the defense. This examination is open to all faculty members of Santa Clara University, but only members of the doctoral committee have a vote. Thesis and Publication At least one month before the degree is conferred, the candidate must submit one copy of the final version of the thesis to the department and one copy to the University Library. The thesis will not be considered as accepted until approved by the doctoral committee and one or more refereed articles based on it are accepted for publication in a professional or scientific journal approved by the doctoral committee. The quality of the refereed journal must be satisfied by one of two criteria: (1) the refereed journal should have an impact factor of at least 1.0; or (2) prior to submitting the candidate’s work to a refereed journal, written approvals on satisfying the journal’s quality should be obtained from the candidate’s advisor, the doctoral committee, the department chair, and the dean’s office. This written approval must be kept in the candidate’s file. Time Limit for Completing Degrees All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee and approved by the Dean of Engineering in consultation with the Research Program Leadership Council. Non-Enrollment Period Ph.D. students are required to enroll in at least one unit for the fall, winter, spring quarters and their final graduating quarter. Those who do not wish to enroll must submit a leave of absence or a withdrawal form to the Engineering Graduate Programs office. A leave of absence form is required if a student plans to miss one or two quarters, while any longer absence requires a withdrawal form. Students who wish to resume their Ph.D. studies after a leave of absence or withdrawal must submit a returning student form. The forms can be found on the graduate engineering website, www.scu.edu/engineering/graduate under current student resources. Leave of absence or withdrawal forms must be submitted by the end of the first week of the quarter. Returning student forms must be submitted three weeks prior to the start of the quarter returning. Please note the request is not guaranteed. Students are required to complete their degree within eight years from their original admit term date. The eight-year time frame includes quarters during which a student was not enrolled. Those who fail to complete their Ph.D. in eight years can request an extension only under special circumstances. In such cases, the student’s advisor will need to discuss the case with the Research Program Leadership Council, which will determine whether an extension is warranted (and for how long). Please Note: Students who miss one or more quarters and fail to submit the appropriate form(s) will be discontinued automatically and will have to reapply to the Ph.D. program. They will need to follow the same procedure as students who withdrew from the program. Additional Graduation Requirements The requirements for the doctoral degree in the School of Engineering have been made to establish the structure in which the degree may be earned. The student’s Ph.D. committee looks at the proposed research and the prior background of the student to determine whether or not there are specific courses that must be added as requirements. The University reserves the right to evaluate the undertakings and the accomplishments of the degree candidate in total and award or withhold the degree as a result of its deliberations. The Industrial Track In addition to our regular Ph.D. program, Engineering Graduate Programs also offers an “industrial track” for working professionals as an option to facilitate the collaboration between academia and industry. Details are as follows: The topic of the research should be coordinated with the needs of the candidate’s employer and must be agreed upon by all parties. This topic must have a component that is publishable and is presentable in open forums. If necessary, a collaborative research agreement will be enacted to indicate the rights of the School and the industrial partner. As a part of the application process, candidates must submit a letter of support from their employer. This letter should contain a pledge of financial support and must identify a co-advisor within the company. The co-advisor shares responsibilities for guiding the candidate’s research with a full- time faculty advisor. This person is also expected to be a member of the doctoral committee. The full-time study component of the residence requirement is waived, but other residence requirements remain the same. Students who opt for this “industrial track” are responsible for meeting all other requirements for the Ph.D. The awarded degree will be the same for all students, regardless of the track that they choose to pursue. Open University Program Engineers who wish to update their skills or learn new technologies without pursuing a specific degree may enroll in the School of Engineering’s Open University program. The Open University program is closed to those students wishing to take Computer Science and Engineering courses. If a student from the Open University program is accepted into a degree program, a maximum of 16 units may apply toward the degree (if the courses are in the same discipline to which the student is accepted). The general GRE test requirement for admission to the master’s degree program will be waived if the student has completed a set of required courses in the department to which they are applying, and has earned a GPA of 3.5 or higher. A list of these courses can be found on the Graduate Engineering website: www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/waiving-the-gre/ Open University students who are considering enrolling in the master’s program should be aware that each specialization has its own set of requirements, and that the number of “free electives” is very limited. Such students are therefore strongly encouraged to choose their classes in consultation with a faculty advisor from the very beginning. Students should remember, however, that all coursework taken at SCU, whether as a degree-seeking or an Open University student becomes a part of the student’s academic history. Please Note: Santa Clara University does not issue F-1 visas to applicants who wish to enter directly into the open university program.

"},"chapter-4-academic-information.html":{"url":"chapter-4-academic-information.html","title":"Chapter 4: Academic Information","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 4: Academic Information Engineering Honor Code The Engineering Honor Code is a long-standing Santa Clara tradition; instituted at the request of engineering students, it states: All students taking courses in the School of Engineering agree, individually and collectively, that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in examinations or other coursework that is to be used by the instructor as the basis of grading. Students and teachers cooperate and share responsibilities under the code. Teachers are responsible for making clear what aid is permissible and for using procedures that minimize temptations to violate the code. Students are responsible for behaving honorably, for actively ensuring that others, as well as themselves, uphold the code, and for being responsive to violations. Alleged violations should be reported to the Office of the Dean. Enrichment Experience The Enrichment Experience is an 8 unit requirement that is common to all departments in the School of Engineering. The various components that are associated with this requirement were designed to broaden the scope of the student’s knowledge, and develop certain skills that are widely perceived as essential for operating in a global environment (such as the ability to communicate clearly, to function on interdisciplinary and diverse teams, and to make ethically and socially responsible decisions). In order to fulfill this requirement, students must take a course in at least two of the three areas (Emerging Topics in Engineering, Engineering and Business/Entrepreneurship, and Engineering and Society) in the Graduate Core (for a minimum of 4 units). Graduate Core The remaining 4 units can be accumulated by: Taking one or more major technical electives Taking additional classes from the Graduate Core Taking Cooperative Education courses Combining courses from categories (a), (b) and (c) Through the Enrichment Experience, in conjunction with students’ specific program of study, Engineering graduate students will achieve the following objectives: 1. Academic competenceGraduate students will demonstrate broad content knowledge and the ability to integrate and apply concepts from their course of study to professional situations. 2. Creative and collaborative learningGraduate students will demonstrate an ability to collaborate in creative ways, and communicate effectively with professionals and others in their discipline. 3. Professional developmentGraduate students will exhibit professionalism, consistent with the University’s Jesuit mission, that includes attention to ethics, integrity, and responsible engagement with their communities–both locally and globally.

Students are encouraged to periodically check for updates regarding new courses in these areas on the graduate engineering website under current student resources. https://www.scu.edu/engineering/current-student-resources/current-graduate-students/graduate-core/ Note 2: The 4 unit Core requirement that is part of the Enrichment Experience cannot be waived, and no substitutions will be approved. Note 3: Transfer credit is not approved for core courses, and all core courses must be taken at SCU. Classes Classes are taught in the following time slots: 7:10-9:00 a.m., 5:10-7:00 p.m., and 7:10-9:00 p.m., Monday through Friday with some Saturday and/or Sunday offerings; 2-unit courses meet one day per week, and four-unit courses meet two days per week. All students are expected to attend the first class meeting of the quarter. Failure to do so can result in an academic withdrawal from the professor of the course. Standards Of Scholarship Only courses in which the student has earned assigned grades of A, B, or C, with plus (+) or minus (-) variations, may be counted for the Master’s or Ph.D. degree. The student must earn a 3.0 cumulative grade point average (GPA) overall, and a 3.0 grade point average (GPA) in their major in the approved minimum 46 units required for the completion of the M.S. degree or the approved minimum 72 units required for the Ph.D. degree. Only credits, not grade points, are transferred from other institutions. Students who have not met the cumulative 3.0 GPA overall or in their major for two consecutive active quarters are eligible for dismissal. The student’s advisor and Department Chair will be notified about their GPA status by e-mail. The decision to be dismissed from the program will be based on a departmental vote, which will be conducted at the request of the advisor and/or Department Chair, and with approval from the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs. Students who have been dismissed from the program can appeal to the Department Chair, and subsequently to the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. EMGT Major Note: In addition to the cumulative GPA requirement, Engineering Management students must also maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher in their EMGT and technical courses. Note 1: Only classes with assigned grades of C- or higher will count toward the completion of the certificates, M.S., or Ph.D. degrees. The grades of all courses completed during the certificate, M.S. or Ph.D. program are used to compile final grade point average (GPA). Note 2: Directed Research, Independent Study, and Engineering courses will not go toward the student’s’major GPA. Only major subject courses will be calculated in the students’ major GPA. Grading System The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes, except that the grade of A may not be modified by a (+). Grade point values per unit are assigned as follows: A = 4.0; A- = 3.7; B+ = 3.3; B = 3.0; B- = 2.7; C+ = 2.3; C = 2; C- = 1.7; D+ = 1.3; D = 1.0; D- = 0.7. F= 0., I (incomplete), P (pass), NP (no pass), and W (withdrawn) are all assigned zero points. Unit credit, but not grade point credit, is awarded when the grade of P is assigned. The P (pass) and NP (no pass) options are not available in engineering management courses. The University also uses the following marks: AUD (audit), I (incomplete), N (continuing work), NP (not passed), NS (no show), and W (withdrawn). No unit credit or grade point value is granted for any of these marks. Please note: Only classes with assigned grades of C- or higher will count toward the completion of the certificates, M.S. or Ph.D. degrees. However, all graded courses will count toward the student’s cumulative grade point average (GPA) Nongraded Courses Courses such as seminars (with the exception of COEN 400 and ELEN 200), Co-ops, etc., are limited to a total of four units and must be approved by the student’s advisor. Incomplete Grades A student’s work may be reported incomplete if, due to illness or other serious circumstance, some essential portion of the coursework remains unfinished after the final examination, or if the thesis has not been completed. An incomplete (I) becomes a failure (F) unless the unfinished work is completed to the satisfaction of the instructor and proper notice is filed with the Office of the Registrar within four weeks from the beginning of the next scheduled quarter, not including summer session. Makeup work must be in the hands of the instructor no later than the end of the third week so that the instructor can meet the four-week submission deadline. An N grade for a thesis course indicates continuing work. A final grade must be submitted before graduation. Auditing Courses A student may take courses with a grading basis of “audit” but needS to keep in mind the following: The current graduate tuition rate of $1083.00 per unit + the $180.00 engineering fee will be charged. No grade points or credit will be earned so the class cannot be counted toward the completion of a certificate, M.S. or Ph.D. A student will need to register for the class, then send an email to the Director of Records requesting that the grading basis be changed to “Audit”: lmjocewicz@scu.edu The last day to request to audit a course is at the end of the first week of the quarter. Repeating Courses A student may, with the permission of the department, repeat a course in which a grade of C- or lower was received on the first attempt. All grades, whether received on the first or second attempt, will be used in computing overall student performance. The units from a course may be counted only once in fulfilling graduation requirements. Withdrawal From Courses Students may change their course registration as stated in the Academic Calendar. Withdrawal from any course may be accomplished up to the 7th Friday of the term. After the fourth week of the quarter, a withdrawal will be recorded as W on the transcript. After the tenth Friday, an emergency that qualifies may be handled as an incomplete (I). Dropping a course without a formal withdrawal will result in a grade of F. Deadlines are strictly adhered to and will result in loss of tuition refund. Program Of Studies During the first quarter of enrollment, a student in the M.S. degree program is required to meet with a faculty advisor to complete a Program of Studies (POS) form. Students can contact their major department for available advisors. The POS must include all planned courses, units and any transfer credit approved by the department. The POS must be signed by the advisor then submitted to the Engineering Graduate Programs Office before the end of the first quarter of enrollment. Failure to do so will result in a registration hold. Variations from the approved Program of Studies may be made either with written approval of the advisor or submitting an updated Program of Studies form with the advisor’s signature to the Engineering Graduate Programs Office. The final Program of Studies form, including all units and transfer credits, must be submitted during the student’s last quarter for graduation. www.scu.edu/engineering/graduate Please Note: Extension, online and continuing education units are not accepted for transfer credit. Courses Transferred From Santa Clara University M.S. students who have an undergraduate degree from Santa Clara University can transfer up to 12 units of eligible graduate level coursework into the program. Only those courses completed with a C grade or better will be eligible for transfer. The units will not transfer if they have been used for another degree. Since these courses were taken at SCU, the grades will count toward the overall grade point average. Courses Transferred From Other Institutions All M.S. students have the option to transfer a maximum of six semester or nine quarter units of graduate level coursework from an accredited institution into their degree program with their advisor’s approval. All Ph.D. students have the option to transfer a maximum of 12 semester or 18 quarter units of graduate level coursework from an accredited institution into their degree program with their advisor’s approval. Please keep the following in mind when transferring units: Only those courses completed with a C grade or better will be eligible for transfer. Extension, continuing education, and online courses may not be transferred. The units will not transfer if they have been used for another degree. Only the credit will transfer, but not grades; so the overall grade point average will be based on coursework completed at Santa Clara University only. An official transcript and course syllabus is required for verification of the units by the student’s advisor and Engineering Graduate Programs. In order to transfer units into a degree program, please follow this procedure: Include those units you wish to transfer in the “Transfer Credit” section of the Program of Studies form and include the Institution Name, Course Number and Title, Grade, Units*, Year and (if applicable) the SCU equivalent course. If no equivalent course is listed, the transfer credit will be processed as general transfer credit. (*Note that 1 semester unit is equivalent to 1.5 quarter units. Please put the quarter unit value on the Program of Studies so that the final total will be correct.) The student’s academic advisor must sign the Program of Studies form and submit it to the Engineering Graduate Programs Office. The Graduate Programs Office must have an official transcript from the school you are transferring units from to review and approve the transfer credit request. NOTE: Courses that were taken more than 10 years ago are generally not acceptable for transfer credit. Students who wish to request an exception must petition the department Chair and receive a written approval with a justification. The final approval is given by the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs. Petition For Graduation It is a student’s responsibility to file a petition for graduation no later than the last day to petition for graduate degrees as indicated in the Academic Calendar. The petition to graduate will only be accepted through online submission and may be found on the graduate engineering website under current student resources : https://www.scu.edu/engineering/current-student-resources/current-graduate-students/petition-to-graduate/ All graduating students must submit a final program of studies and enroll in at least one unit for their final quarter. Please Note: Eligibility to participate in the June Commencement ceremony will be based on the completion of all requirements, all units and a thesis, by the end of the spring quarter or participation in the ceremony will be delayed until the following June. Cooperative Education Option The objective of cooperative education is to provide students with the opportunity, through the interaction of study and work experience, to enhance their academic knowledge, to further their personal work experience, and to learn about working with people. The Cooperative Education option integrates classroom work with practical industrial experience. It alternates or parallels periods of college education with periods of practical training in industry. The industrial training is related to the field of study in which the student is engaged and often is diversified to afford a wide range of experience. To qualify for this study option, students must complete at least 24 graduate level units at Santa Clara University. Please note that COEN 900 level courses and transfer credit do not count toward the 24-unit requirement. Students who wish to pursue this option through curricular practical training (CPT) must enroll in ENGR 288. This class is a prerequisite for ENGR 289, and must be taken before you begin an internship. To be eligible to enroll in ENGR 288 students must complete at least 16 units of graduate level courses by the end of their second quarter at SCU, or demonstrate that they will complete 24 units of graduate-level coursework by the end of their third quarter with department chair approval. Those who plan to start (or continue) their CPT after they have taken ENGR 288 must enroll in ENGR 289 (which is allowed for credit up to three times).** Students who were authorized for CPT but did not receive a passing grade in ENGR 288 or ENGR 289 will not be eligible for future CPT authorization since they did not complete the academic requirements associated with their internship. ** Note 1: ENGR 288 is not offered in the summer quarter. Students who plan to participate in a summer internship need to enroll in ENGR 288 in the Spring quarter. Concurrent Enrollment Concurrent Enrollment means that a student is enrolled in two places at the same time. An international student at Santa Clara University may be given permission to engage in Concurrent Enrollment provided the student meets the following USCIS requirements: Combined enrollment amounts to a full course of study The student has been granted permission from a faculty advisor to enroll at another college (advisor must sign Concurrent Enrollment Form) Must receive written approval from DSO at International Student Services The student is making normal progress at Santa Clara and is not in danger of probation or disqualification Any NON-vocational coursework from the other school will be accepted for fulfilling degree requirements at SCU For more information, please contact the International Student Services Office at 408-554-4318 or refer to website: www.scu.edu/globalengagement/international-students Non-enrollment Period Students in the Master’s and Ph.D. program are expected to enroll in at least one unit for the fall, winter and spring quarters. Those students who do not wish to enroll must submit a leave of absence or a withdrawal form to the Engineering Graduate Programs Office. A leave of absence form is required if a student plans to miss one or two quarters, while a more prolonged absence requires a withdrawal form. Students who wish to resume their Master’s or Ph.D. studies after a leave of absence or withdrawal from the program must submit a returning student form. The forms can be found on the graduate engineering website: www.scu.edu/engineering/graduate under current student resources. Leave of absence or withdrawal forms must be submitted by the end of the first week of the quarter. Returning student’s forms must be submitted three weeks prior to the start of the quarter returning. Please note the return request is not guaranteed. M.S. students are required to complete their degree within six years from their original admit term date. The six-year time frame includes quarters during which a student was not enrolled. Ph.D. students are required to complete their degree within eight years from their original admit term date. The eight-year time frame includes quarters during which a student is not enrolled. Note: Students who miss a quarter and fail to submit the appropriate form(s) with the Graduate Programs Office will be automatically discontinued as a no show status and will be required to submit a returning student form. This is the same procedure for students who took a leave of absence or withdrew from the program. Withdrawal From The University Withdrawal from the University is not officially complete until students clear all of their financial obligations with the Bursar’s Office. Students on deferments or a Federal Perkins Loan must also clear their financial obligations with the Credit Counseling Office. Student Records And Release Of Information The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) is the federal law that protects the confidentiality of the educational records of students maintained by the University and affords students certain rights with respect to those records. A student is any person who attends or has attended a class at the University, which includes courses taken through videoconference, satellite, internet, or other electronic and telecommunication technologies. Students' rights under FERPA include: The right to inspect and review educational records Students have the right to inspect and review their education records. Students should submit a written request to the Office of the Registrar that specifies what records the students would like to inspect and review. Within 45 days of receipt of the request, the Office of the Registrar will make arrangements for access and will notify students of the time and place where the records may be reviewed. The right to seek amendment to educational records Students have the right to request the amendment of their educational records to ensure that those records are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of students' privacy or other rights. Students who wish to seek an amendment to a record should write the University Registrar, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it should be changed. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested, the University will notify students in writing of the decision and their right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to students when notified of the right to a hearing. The right to consent to disclosure of educational records Students have the right to consent to the disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in their educational records. In some instances, the University may disclose personally identifiable information from a student's educational record without the student's consent. One such instance is to a school official who has a legitimate educational interest in the record. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position; a person elected to the Board of Trustees; or a person or entity under contract with the University who has been designated a school official by the University and is performing specific duties for the University that require a legitimate educational interest. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review any educational records in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. The University is authorized under provisions of FERPA to release directory information without the student's prior consent, unless a student explicitly requests in writing that the University not do so and keep directory information confidential. Directory information is designated as follows: Name Address: Campus post office box, local, and permanent addresses (residence hall and room numbers are not disclosed) Telephone number Email address Photograph Date and place of birth Major field of study Classification level/academic standing Dates of attendance (defined as academic year or quarter) Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Weight and height of members of athletic teams Degrees (including expected or actual degree date), honors and awards received, and dates Most recent educational agency or institution attended https://www.scu.edu/registrar/ Students may submit a Request to Prevent Disclosure of Directory Information form to the Office of the Registrar, which directs the University not to disclose directory information. Once filed, the nondisclosure remains in effect until the beginning of the next academic year or a shorter period if designated by a student. Graduating students must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing to remove the nondisclosure from their record. Former or current borrowers of funds from any Title IV student loan program should note carefully that nondisclosure will not prevent the University from releasing information pertinent to employment, enrollment status, current address, and loan account status to a school lender, subsequent holder, guarantee agency, the United States Department of Education, or an authorized agent. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Students have the right to file a complaint with the United States Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Written complaints should be directed to the Family Policy Compliance Office, Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, D.C. 20202-5920.

Students may designate a third party (e.g., parent, family member, spouse) to be an authorized user for the purpose of reviewing student account, billing information, and remitting payment on the student’s behalf. However, it is ultimately the student’s responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the published deadlines. Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through University eCampus. A billing notification will be sent to the student’s assigned SCU gmail account and to the email address of any authorized user. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remittance. Information on a student’s account cannot be provided to any third-party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University. Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees associated with their enrollment status by the published term payment deadline. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to pre-pay for their enrollment. Registered students who do not withdraw formally from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their account as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees. Additional information, including detailed instructions on Santa Clara’s billing and payment procedures, is located at the website: www.scu.edu/bursar Graduate Programs Billing Dates and Deadlines The following dates are the initial payment deadlines for each quarter: Fall 2020 Billing available August 1; payment due August 21 Winter 2021 Billing available December 1; payment due December 21 Spring 2021 Billing available March 1; payment due March 21 Summer 2021 Billing available May 1; payment due May 21 Payment Methods Santa Clara University offers a variety of payment methods to students to assist with their financial obligations: Payment by Electronic Check A student or authorized user may make online payments by authorizing a fund transfer directly from their personal checking or savings account through a third-party website accessible via the University eCampus system. The payer can make electronic check payments without incurring a transaction fee. Payment by Mail Payment for student account charges is accepted by mail utilizing the University’s cash management service lock box. The payer should download a copy of the student billing statement, enclose it with a personal or cashier’s check payable to “Santa Clara University” and mail both items to SCU Payment Processing, P.O. Box 550, Santa Clara, CA 95052-0550. Payment in Person Payments for student account charges may be made in person by cash or check only at the One Stop Office in the Admissions & Enrollment Services Building. This office is not able to accept any electronic forms of payment. However, there are computer kiosks located in the One Stop Office for the convenience of students and their payers who wish to make electronic payments. The University does not accept debit or credit card payments for student account charges. International Payment by Wire Transfer International students may submit payment quickly and securely by going to www.flywire.com/scu. Students are able to benefit from excellent exchange rates, and payment can usually be made in the student’s home currency. Extended Payments Options Currently enrolled students are eligible to enroll in a monthly payment plan to assist with budgeting needs. The online monthly payment plan can be accessed by logging into eCampus and selecting the Financial Account Tile. There is a non-refundable enrollment fee each quarter, but no interest is charged during the payment term. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar’s Office website: www.scu.edu/bursar/. Delinquent Payments If all charges on a student’s account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement by the payment deadline, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student’s account and a hold will be placed on the student’s record. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval, are subject to dismissal from the University. All outstanding balances will accrue ten percent interest per annum on the remaining balance from the date of default in accordance with California state law. Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recovering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University. Billing Disputes If a student wishes to dispute any charge on their billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to Santa Clara University, Bursar’s Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar’s Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the item in question appeared. Communication can be made by telephone but doing so will not preserve the student’s rights. Communication should include the student’s name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress; all other items not in question must be paid by the due date. If the amount in question is found to be correct, payment must be submitted to the Bursar’s Office immediately upon notification. Refund Payments Refunds will be granted only for student accounts reflecting a credit balance. A refund will not be granted based on anticipated aid. All financial aid must be disbursed into a student’s account before a refund is processed. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that all necessary documentation is completed and submitted to the Financial Aid office so that aid can be disbursed properly and in a timely fashion. Payment received by personal check will have a 14-calendar day hold before a refund can be issued; electronic check payments require a 7-day hold. Credits from overpayments on student accounts will remain on the account for future charges or refunded to the original payer. Fall, Winter, and Spring Quarters Graduate students who drop courses or withdraw from the University during fall, winter, or spring term will receive a tuition refund in accordance with the following: By the end of the first week of classes – 100% tuition refund, less any applicable fees By the end of the second week of classes – 50% tuition refund, less any applicable fees By the end of the third week of classes – 25% tuition refund, less any applicable fees After the third week of classes – zero tuition refund Summer Students who drop courses or withdraw from the University during the summer session term will receive a tuition refund in accordance with the following: By the end of day of the second-class meeting – 100% tuition refund, less any applicable fees By the end of day of the third-class meeting – 50% tuition refund, less any applicable fees Saturday/Sunday Courses/Off Cycle Courses Students enrolled in a weekend course in which the first class meeting is after the first week of the term must provide written notification, to the Graduate Programs Office, of their intent to withdraw or drop any weekend/off cycle course(s). Failure to comply with this process will result in a forfeit of tuition. The following refund schedule applies: Students will receive a 100% tuition refund, less any applicable fees, if written notification is received by 5 p.m. on the Tuesday immediately following the first-class meeting. Students will receive a 50% tuition refund, less any applicable fees, if written notification is received by 5 p.m. on the Tuesday immediately following the second-class meeting. To receive tuition refunds from the Bursar’s Office, course drops must be handled administratively. Students should NOT drop a weekend/off cycle course themselves through eCampus after the first week of the quarter. Please Note: If you withdraw or drop below half-time status you may no longer be eligible to receive financial aid or student loans. Your account will be adjusted accordingly, and the aid returned to the appropriate program. If you have received a refund for these funds, you must reimburse Santa Clara University immediately. For more information on financial aid forfeiture, please visit the Financial Aid website or make an appointment with your financial aid counselor. One-Unit Courses Students enrolled in a one-unit course must provide written notification to their respective Records Office of their intent to withdraw or drop any course(s). Failure to comply with this process will result in a forfeit of tuition. The following refund schedule applies: Students will receive a 100% tuition refund, less any applicable fees, if written notification is received within two business days prior to the first-class meeting. Students will receive a 50% tuition refund, less any applicable fees, after the first-class meeting unless the course has only one session, in which case no refund will be granted. Financial Hardship Students who withdraw from the University or drop courses due to an illness, injury, or psychological/emotional condition are eligible for a tuition refund in accordance with the schedule above. Tuition insurance may be purchased to cover tuition charges for medically related withdrawals that occur after the first week of the term. Santa Clara University degree students who withdraw from the University or who are administratively withdrawn from the University after the third week of the term due to a qualifying financial hardship may be eligible for an allocation from the student hardship fund for 25 percent of the tuition charges for that term. Qualifying financial hardships include (1) death, disabling injury, medical emergency, (2) loss of job by an independent student, (3) medical or other emergency involving a dependent of an independent student, and (4) student deployment for active military duty. The Vice Provost for Student Life or designee, in consultation with the Financial Aid Office, will determine qualifying financial hardships and any allocation from the student hardship fund. **Students must submit a request for an allocation from the student hardship fund by the end of the applicable term. No tuition refunds are made because of curtailed services resulting from strikes, acts of God, civil insurrection, riots, or threats thereof, or other causes beyond the control of the University. Tuition Insurance Protection Students and families may protect themselves against financial loss due to unexpected withdrawal from the University for a diagnosed medical or mental health reasons by purchasing tuition insurance coverage. The University has identified an insurance company, A.W.G. Dewar Inc., to provide an optional insurance protection plan. This plan is designed to protect from loss of funds paid for tuition should it be necessary to withdraw completely from the University during the term for medical or mental health reasons. Information on the tuition insurance plan is available from the Bursar’s Office and on Dewars’ website. Financial Aid Students must be enrolled at least part-time status (4 units) to receive Federal financial aid. California State Graduate Fellowships State graduate fellowships are awarded to California residents pursuing a recognized graduate or professional degree who intend to pursue teaching as a career and who have not completed more than four quarters of full-time graduate work as of October 1. Selection is based on state manpower needs, academic performance, and financial need. Applicants should apply using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is available at website: www.fafsa.ed.gov/. Loans Students applying for aid may find the most advantageous method of financing their education through loan programs. Among those available to students of the School of Engineering are the Federal Perkins Loan and Federal Stafford Loans through the School as Lender Program. Applicants should apply using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is available at website: www.fafsa.ed.gov/. Please Note: A student must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen to qualify for federal sources of financial assistance. Deadlines The Financial Aid Office has established deadlines for consideration of the various programs it administers. All students requesting financial aid from the University should contact the Financial Aid Office at the earliest possible date to request specific deadline information and appropriate application materials. Files completed later than February 1 for new recipients and March 2 for current recipients will receive consideration on a funds-available basis. All financial aid deadlines are posted on the Financial Aid website: www.scu.edu/financialaid. Veterans and Veterans' Dependents Assistance Santa Clara University has been certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 percent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill®), Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®), and Yellow Ribbon. Individuals interested in attending under any of the veteran assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar. GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill. Teaching and Research Assistantships The School of Engineering offers a limited number of teaching and research assistantships providing up to eight units of tuition and, in some cases, a modest stipend. For further information, students are encouraged to contact their faculty advisor or their academic department. University-Awarded Aid Individual graduate schools may grant their students a specific amount of financial aid, per term, in the form of Santa Clara University school scholarships. Once the amount has been determined by the school, the information is sent to the Financial Aid Office for processing. The Financial Aid Office awards the aid and sends an email notification to the student’s SCU gmail address only, informing them of their financial aid package and/or any aid revision. Students will be able to see their school scholarship award on e-campus. The award amount will also appear as “anticipated aid” on the student’s account to alleviate the assessment of holds/late fees from the Bursar’s Office. Generally, financial aid is disbursed to the student’s account ten days before the start of classes each term. If eligible, the Bursar’s Office will issue refunds to students reflecting credit balances after the first week of class. Cancellation of Financial Aid and Return of Funds Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are subject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal financial aid funds governed under Title IV. Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to the state or University financial aid programs and/or the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received federal Title IV assistance: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans) Subsidized Federal Direct Loans Federal Perkins Loans Federal Direct Grad PLUS Loans Federal PELL Grants for which a return is required Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants for which a return is required TEACH Grants for which a return is required Iraq and Afghanistan Grants for which a return is required "},"chapter-6-graduate-minor-in-science-technology-and-society-sts.html":{"url":"chapter-6-graduate-minor-in-science-technology-and-society-sts.html","title":"Chapter 6: Graduate Minor in Science, Technology, and Society (STS)","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 6: Graduate Minor in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) Program Advisor: Dr. Aleksandar Zecevic Program Description The graduate minor in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) is designed to help students gain a deeper understanding of the influence that engineering has on society (and vice versa). Knowledge of this kind has become essential in an increasingly complex and interconnected world, in which purely technical expertise often needs to be supplemented by additional skills. In order to successfully operate in such an environment, engineers must (at the very least) have the ability to communicate clearly, function on interdisciplinary and diverse teams, and make ethically and socially responsible decisions. The need to develop such skills has been widely recognized in universities around the country, as witnessed by the growing emphasis on interdisciplinary studies in undergraduate engineering curricula. It is unusual, however, to encounter programs of this kind on the graduate level. Most traditional master’s programs still focus on specialized technical topics and offer little insight into how practicing engineers might engage global challenges such as climate change, sustainability, or economic disparity (to name just a few). The primary purpose of the STS minor is to offer graduate students an opportunity to examine some of these key social issues on an advanced level. The scope of the minor is broad and includes topics that range from the social impact of new technologies, to applied ethics, sustainability, and religion. As such, it reflects an educational philosophy that goes well beyond narrow specialization and promotes a global and societal orientation. All the courses in this program have a distinctly interdisciplinary flavor, and are designed to develop creativity, innovation, and leadership. The minor consists of a Core and a set of electives and entails a minimum of 12 units of coursework. It is open to all students who are pursuing a master’s degree in engineering, regardless of the specific program in which they are enrolled. Program Requirements The STS minor consists of a Core and a set of electives and entails a minimum of 12 units of coursework. The Core courses cover four distinct thematic areas: • Social and Philosophical Issues in Science and Engineering • Engineering and Ethics • Science and Religion • Sustainability and Engineering Students will be required to take courses in at least three of the Core areas outlined above (for a minimum of 6 units). The remaining units (up to a total of 12, or more if desired) can be accumulated by taking a combination of electives and additional STS Core courses. The courses and the different thematic areas to which they belong are listed below. Note that courses that appear in multiple areas can be used to satisfy only one Core requirement (in other words, no “double dipping” is allowed).

Those who wish to pursue this minor must submit an application form to the Graduate Services Office by the end of their third quarter at SCU (at the latest), and must have their program of studies approved by the academic advisor for this program (Dr. Aleksander Zecevic). Links to the application form and the program of studies form can be found at the website: www.scu.edu/engineering/graduate Students who complete all the technical requirements set by their department, as well as an approved set of STS classes, will receive a master’s degree with a minor in Science, Technology, and Society. The degree will be conferred by the department to which the student was originally accepted. Please note that the grades obtained in STS courses will be included in the overall GPA and will carry the same weight as grades obtained in technical classes. There are no financial or academic penalties for not completing the minor. Such students will receive the standard master’s degree, with no reference to the STS minor. Financial Aid for the STS Minor Students who have declared a graduate minor in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) are eligible for a special form of financial aid. The amount of aid is limited to 75% of tuition for up to 12 units (excluding fees). These funds can be applied only to courses taken beyond the 45 units that are required for a master’s degree. In order to become eligible for this benefit, students must check the appropriate box that pertains to financial aid on the application form. In addition, their program of studies must be approved by the academic advisor for the program (Dr. Aleksandar Zecevic). Financial aid comes into effect once a student completes 46 units of course work, at which point he or she should follow the procedure outlined below: The quarterly tuition must be paid in full, and in the timeframe specified by the Bursar’s Office. In the second week of each quarter, students must provide the program academic advisor with a list of courses in which they are currently enrolled (this will require official proof of registration). Once the academic advisor establishes that the courses conform to the approved programs of studies (both in the technical and in the STS area), students will receive financial aid in the amount of 75% of their tuition expenses for that quarter (excluding fees).

At approximately one-third of the units required for a master’s degree, the certificate is designed to be completed in a much shorter period of time. These certificate programs are appropriate for students working in industry who wish to update their skills or for those interested in changing their career path. Interdisciplinary Certificate in Frugal Innovation Advisor: Dr. Aleksandar Zecevic Over the past two decades, global trends have been forcing businesses to adapt to growing consumer bases in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which are in desperate need of low-cost and high-quality solutions to the challenges that they face. The importance of these new “economic realities” is underscored by the fact that emerging markets are expected to exceed 50% of the world’s GDP in 2017 (according to IMF estimates). In order to excel professionally in such an environment, engineers will have to be equipped with the knowledge and skill sets to appropriately define, design, and implement solutions that are not merely a “stripping down” of Western products to meet the rising demand. Industry, particularly in Silicon Valley, is becoming increasingly aware of this fact and has begun to move toward a ‘Triple Bottom Line’ approach to business, which integrates environmental, societal, and financial considerations. The Certificate in Frugal Innovation is designed to give students the ability and the tools to adapt to this new model, and to expand their understanding of the impact that engineering has on society. This program is suitable for working professionals in a wide variety of engineering disciplines. To enroll, students must have a B.S in Engineering from an accredited institution, and should maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 in order to receive the certificate.

Eskafi, Keyvan Moataghed, Yuan Wang Overview “Computing sits at the crossroads among the central processes of applied mathematics, science, and engineering. The three processes have equal and fundamental importance in the discipline, which uniquely blends theory, abstraction, and design.” –1989 Task Force Report on the Core of Computer Science prepared by the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society. The most successful graduates in the field of computing are those who understand computers as systems—not just the design of hardware or software, but also the relationships and interdependencies between them and the underlying theory of computation. The department offers a variety of degree and certificate programs, including courses that cover the breadth of the discipline, from the engineering aspects of hardware and software design to the underlying theory of computation. Degree Programs Students are required to meet with their advisors to define and file a program of study during their first quarter. In general, no credit is allowed for courses that duplicate prior coursework, including courses listed as degree requirements. Students should arrange adjustment of these requirements with their academic advisor when they file their program of study. With the prior written consent of the advisor, master’s students may take a maximum of 12 units of coursework for graduate credit from selected senior-level undergraduate courses. Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering (MSCSE) All students admitted to the MSCSE program are expected to already have competence in the fundamental subjects listed below, as required within an accredited program for a B.S. in Computer Science Engineering.. An applicant without such background (but who has completed college level calculus and advanced programming) may still be admitted, provided the deficiencies are corrected by coursework that is in addition to the normal degree requirements, and that is completed within the first year of graduate study. Alternatively, a student may take a similar course at another approved accredited institution. Online, continuing education, extension courses, and courses without a closed book exam are not accepted. The subjects and corresponding SCU courses that may be used to correct the deficiencies include: Logic design COEN 21 or 921C Data structures COEN 12 or 912C Computer organization & assembly language COEN 20 or 920C or ELEN 33 Discrete math AMTH 240 Probability AMTH 210 One of the following: Differential Equations (AMTH 106), Numerical Analysis (AMTH 220, 221), or Linear Algebra (AMTH 245, 246) One additional advanced programming course or one year of programming experience in industry. The SCU COEN and ELEN courses listed above and AMTH 106 are considered undergraduate-level and may not be used to satisfy the requirements for the M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. However, students who have satisfied item 6 above, but who have never studied numerical analysis, may use AMTH 220/221 as electives; students who have satisfied item 6 above, but who have never studied linear algebra, may use AMTH 245/246 as electives. Laboratory components are not required for the above courses. Degree Requirements Engineering Graduate Core- Enrichment Experience Students must take a minimum of 8 units of the Graduate Core Enrichment Experience courses as described in Chapter 4, Academic Information. MSCSE Core COEN 210, 279, and 283 Students who have taken one or more of these core courses or their equivalent must replace said course(s) with the advanced course equivalent (COEN 313, 379, and/or 383) or, with their advisor’s approval, replace said course(s) with elective(s). MSCSE Electives A student must take a minimum of 8 units of COEN 300-899 courses. CSE electives must be approved by the advisor. Electives: Sufficient units to bring the total to at least 46. (The maximum number of non-COEN graduate units allowed is 10 units, including those from the Engineering Graduate Core, and courses must be approved by the advisor.) Please Note: Students wishing to do a thesis (COEN 497) should consult with their academic advisor regarding a modification of these requirements. Master of Science in Software Engineering (MSSE) We are currently not accepting applications for the Master of Science in Software Engineering program. Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science and Engineering The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is conferred by the School of Engineering primarily in recognition of competence in the subject field and the ability to investigate engineering problems independently, resulting in a new contribution to knowledge in the field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a thesis based on that research, and a program of advanced study in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences. The student’s work is directed by the department, subject to the general supervision of the School of Engineering. See Chapter 2, Academic Programs and Requirements, and Chapter 3, Admissions, for details on admission and general degree requirements. The following departmental information augments the general requirements. Preliminary Exam A preliminary written exam is offered at least once per year by the School of Engineering as needed. The purpose is to ascertain the depth and breadth of the student’s preparation and suitability for Ph.D. work. Faculty Advisor The student and his or her advisor jointly develop a complete program of study for research in a particular area. The complete program of study (and any subsequent changes) must be filed with the Engineering Graduate Programs Office and approved by the student’s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that courses taken will be acceptable toward the Ph.D. course requirements. Doctoral Committee After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of which must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members. In addition, acceptance of publications with the student as the primary (first) author is required. More details are described in Chapter 2, Academic Programs and Requirements. Time Limit for Completing Degree All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee and approved by the dean of engineering in consultation with the Research Program Leadership Council (RPLC). Engineer’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering The program leading to the engineer’s degree is particularly designed for the education of the practicing engineer. The degree is granted on completion of an approved academic program and a record of acceptable technical achievement in the candidate’s field of engineering. The academic program consists of a minimum of 46 units beyond the master’s degree. Courses are selected to advance competence in specific areas relating to the engineering professional’s work. Evidence of technical achievement must include a paper principally written by the candidate and accepted for publication by a recognized engineering journal prior to the granting of the degree. A letter from the journal accepting the paper must be submitted to the department chairperson. In certain cases, the department may accept publication in the proceedings of an appropriate conference. Admission to the program will generally be granted to those students who demonstrate superior ability in meeting the requirements for their master’s degree. Normally, the master’s degree is earned in the same field as that in which the engineer’s degree is sought. Students who have earned a master’s degree from Santa Clara University must file a new application (by the deadline) to continue work toward the engineer’s degree. A program of study for the engineer’s degree should be developed with the assistance of an advisor and submitted during the first term of enrollment. Certificate Programs Certificate programs are designed to provide intensive background in a narrow area at the graduate level. At roughly one-third of the units of a master’s degree program, the certificate is designed to be completed in a much shorter period of time. These certificate programs are appropriate for students working in industry who wish to enhance their skills in an area in which they already have some background knowledge. We are currently not accepting applications for certificate programs in Computer Science and Engineering.

Overview The field of electrical and computer engineering covers the design, construction, testing, and operation of electrical components, circuits, and systems. Electrical and computer engineers work with information representation, processing and transmission; advancing integrated circuit design for digital, analog, and mixed signals systems; designing and characterizing antennas, RF, microwave and millimeter-wave Systems; new devices and architectures, energy systems and renewable energy; nanotechnology; and all the areas of information circuits and systems that have traditionally supported these efforts. This includes all phases of the digital or analog transmission of information, such as in mobile communications and networks, radio, television, telephone systems, fiber optics, and satellite communications, as well as control and robotics, electric power, information processing, and storage. The Electrical and Computer Engineering Programs are supported by the facilities of the University’s Academic Computing Center, as well as by the Engineering Computing Center. The department supports 10 major teaching and research laboratories, five additional laboratories used only for teaching, and a laboratory dedicated to the support of design projects. The five teaching laboratories cover the fields of digital systems, electric circuits, electronics, systems, and RF and communication. Master’s Degree Program And Requirements The master’s degree will be granted to degree candidates who complete a program of studies approved by a faculty advisor. The degree does not require a thesis, but students may include a thesis in their program with up to nine units for their thesis work. The program must consist of no less than 46 units. In addition, a 3.0 GPA (B average) must be earned in all coursework taken at Santa Clara University. Residence requirements are met by completing 37 units of the graduate program at Santa Clara University. A maximum of nine quarter units (six-semester units) of graduate-level coursework may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor. All units applied toward the degree, including those transferred from other institutions, must be earned within six years from initial enrollment. Students must develop a program of studies with an academic advisor and file the approved program during their first term of enrollment at Santa Clara University. The program of studies must contain a minimum of 46 units of graduate-level engineering courses which include at least 27 units of courses offered within the electrical and computer department and no more than four units of engineering management courses. The program of studies must include the following: Graduate Core-Enrichment Experience (minimum 8 units): See descriptions in Chapter 4, Academic Information Applied Mathematics (4 units) Electrical and Computer Engineering primary focus area (minimum 6 units). Students must select and meet the requirements of one of the six focus areas listed below. Power Systems and Control Take either (236 or 281A) and two courses selected from (211, 232, 281B, 333) IC Design and Technology Take three courses selected from (252, 261, 270, 387) RF and Applied Electromagnetics Take 201 and two courses selected from (202, 203, 204, 624, 701, 706) Signal Processing and Machine Learning Take 233 and two courses selected from (234, 421, 431, 520, 640, 644) Digital Systems Take 501 , 511, and 603 Communications Take both 241 and 243, and one course selected from (244, 444, 446) Electrical and Computer Engineering breadth: (minimum 4 units) Two other focus areas must be selected as breadth areas. For each breadth area, one of the courses specified in the list above is required. Additional graduate courses recommended and approved by the graduate program advisor. These M.S. degree requirements may be adjusted by the advisor based on the student’s previous graduate work. An advisor may approve selected undergraduate classes that do not duplicate course content of graduate courses in the program of studies. No more than 15 units of electives may be selected from the following upper-division undergraduate courses: 105, 112, 116, 117, 118, 130, 133, 141, 144, 151, 152, 153, 156, 160, 164, 183 and 184. Alterations in the approved program, consistent with the above departmental requirements, may be requested at any time by a petition initiated by the student and approved by the advisor. Students with relevant technical backgrounds may be admitted to the master’s program without an undergraduate degree in electrical or electrical and computer engineering from an accredited program. In order to guarantee prerequisites for graduate courses, those students must take sufficient additional courses beyond the 46-unit minimum to ensure coverage of all areas of the undergraduate EE core requirements. A student who has earned a Fundamentals of Electrical and Computer Engineering Certificate will have satisfied these background requirements. Undergraduate Core Courses ELEN 21 Introduction to Logic Design ELEN 50 Electric Circuits I ELEN 100 Electric Circuits II ELEN 104 Electromagnetics I ELEN 110 Linear Systems ELEN 115 Electronic Circuits I ELEN 120 Microprocessor System Design The advisor will determine which courses must be taken to meet these requirements. Undergraduate core courses will not be included in the 46 units required for the master’s degree. Please Note: In general, no credit will be allowed for courses that duplicate prior coursework, including courses listed above as degree requirements. (However, graduate-level treatment of a topic is more advanced than an undergraduate course with a similar title.) Students should discuss any adjustments of these requirements with their academic advisor before filing their program of studies. In all cases, prerequisite requirements should be interpreted to mean the course specified or an equivalent course taken elsewhere. Engineer’s Degree Program And Requirements The program leading to the Engineer’s Degree is particularly designed for the education of the practicing engineer. The degree is granted on completion of an approved academic program and a record of acceptable technical achievement in the candidate’s field of engineering. The academic program consists of a minimum of 46 quarter units beyond the master’s degree. Courses are selected to advance competence in specific areas relating to the engineering professional’s work. Evidence of technical achievement must include a paper principally written by the candidate and accepted for publication by a recognized engineering journal prior to the granting of the degree. A letter from the journal accepting the paper must be submitted to the department chair. In certain cases, the department may accept publication in the peer-reviewed proceedings of an appropriate national or international conference. Electrical and Computer Engineering courses at the introductory Master of Science level (e.g., ELEN 210, 211, 212, 230, 231, 236, 241, 250, 261; and AMTH 210, 211, 220, 221, 230, 231, 235, 236, 240, 245, 246) are not generally acceptable in an Engineer’s Degree program of studies. However, with the approval of the advisor, the student may include up to three of these courses in the Engineer’s Degree program. The department also requires that at least 15 units of the program of studies be in topics other than the student’s major field of concentration. Candidates admitted to the Electrical and Computer Engineering Program who have M.S. degrees in fields other than electrical and computer engineering must include in their graduate programs (M.S. and Engineer’s Degree combined) a total of at least 46 units of graduate-level electrical and computer engineering coursework approved by an academic advisor. Ph.D. Program And Requirements The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is conferred by the School of Engineering primarily in recognition of competence in the subject field and the ability to investigate engineering problems independently, resulting in a new contribution to knowledge in the field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a thesis based on that research, and a program of advanced studies in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Bioengineering are collaborating to offer a Ph.D. in interdisciplinary topics related to Bioengineering. Faculty from both departments will co-advise the Ph.D. students and the degree will be awarded by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Preliminary Examination The preliminary examination shall be written and shall include subject matter deemed by the major department to represent sufficient preparation in depth and breadth for advanced study in the major. Only those who pass the written examination may take the oral qualifying examination. Students currently studying at Santa Clara University for a master’s degree who are accepted for the Ph.D. program and who are at an advanced stage of the M.S. program may, with the approval of their academic advisor, take the preliminary examination before completing the M.S. degree requirements. Students who have completed the M.S. degree requirements and have been accepted for the Ph.D. program should take the preliminary examination as soon as possible but not more than two years after beginning the program. Only those students who pass the preliminary examination shall be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. The preliminary examination may be repeated only once, and then only at the discretion of the thesis advisor. General Requirements Thesis Advisor It is the student’s responsibility to obtain consent from a full-time faculty member in the student’s major department to serve as his/her prospective thesis advisor. It is strongly recommended that Ph.D. students find a thesis advisor before taking the preliminary examination. After passing the preliminary examination, Ph.D. students should have a thesis advisor before the beginning of the next quarter following the preliminary examination. Students currently pursuing a master’s degree at the time of theirpreliminary examination should have a thesis advisor as soon as possible after being accepted as a Ph.D. student. The student and the thesis advisor jointly develop a complete program of studies for research in a particular area. The complete program of studies (and any subsequent changes) must be filed with the Graduate Programs Office and approved by the student’s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that courses taken will be acceptable toward the Ph.D. course requirements. Doctoral Committee After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of whom must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members. Residence The doctoral degree is granted based on achievement, rather than on the accumulation of units of credit. However, the candidate is expected to complete a minimum of 72 quarter units of graduate credit beyond the master’s degree. Of these, 36 quarter units may be earned through coursework and independent study, and 36 through the thesis. All Ph.D. thesis units are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. A maximum of 18 quarter units (12-semester units) may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor. Ph.D. students must undertake a minimum of four consecutive quarters of full-time study at the University; spring and fall quarters are considered consecutive. The residency time shall normally be any period between passing the preliminary examination and completion of the thesis. For this requirement, full-time study is interpreted as a minimum registration of eight units per quarter during the academic year and four units during the summer session. Any variation from this requirement must be approved by the doctoral committee. Comprehensive Examinations and Admission to Candidacy After completion of the formal coursework approved by the doctoral committee, the student shall present his/her research proposal as part of a comprehensive oral examination on the coursework and the subject of his/her research work. The student should make arrangements for the comprehensive examinations through the doctoral committee. A student who passes the comprehensive examinations is considered a degree candidate. The comprehensive examinations typically must be completed within four years from the time the student is admitted to the doctoral program. Comprehensive examinations may be repeated once, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the doctoral committee. Thesis Research and Defense The period following the comprehensive examinations is devoted to research for the thesis, although such research may begin before the examinations are complete. After successfully completing the comprehensive examinations, the student must pass an oral examination on his/her research and thesis, conducted by the doctoral committee and whomever they appoint as examiners. The thesis must be made available to all examiners one month prior to the examination. The oral examination shall consist of a presentation of the results of the thesis and the defense. This examination is open to the public, but only members of the doctoral committee have a vote. Thesis and Publication At least one month before the degree is conferred, the candidate must submit one copy of the final version of the thesis to the department and one copy to the University Library. The thesis will not be considered as accepted until approved by the doctoral committee and one or more refereed articles based on it are accepted for publication in a professional or scientific journal approved by the doctoral committee. The quality of the refereed journal must be satisfied by one of two criteria: (1) the refereed journal should have an impact factor of at least 1.0; or (2) prior to submitting the candidate’s work to a refereed journal, written approvals on satisfying the journal’s quality should be obtained from the candidate’s advisor, the doctoral committee, the department chair, and the dean’s office. This written approval must be kept in the candidate’s file. Time Limit for Completing Degree All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. This includes any leave of absences/withdrawals. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee and approved by the dean of engineering in consultation with the Research Program Leadership Council. Additional Graduation Requirements The requirements for the doctoral degree in the School of Engineering have been made to establish the structure in which the degree may be earned. Upon written approval of the provost, the dean of the School of Engineering, the doctoral committee, and the chair of the major department, other degree requirements may be established. The University reserves the right to evaluate the undertakings and the accomplishments of the degree candidate in total, and award or withhold the degree as a result of its deliberations. Certificate Programs General Information Certificate programs are designed to provide an intensive background in a narrow area at the graduate level. At roughly one-third of the units of a master’s degree program, the certificate is designed to be completed in a much shorter period of time. These certificate programs are appropriate for students working in the industry who wish to update their skills or those interested in changing their career path. Students can only take courses that are required for the certificate. Admission To be accepted into a certificate program, the applicant must have a bachelor’s degree and meet any additional requirements for the specific certificate. Exceptions based on work experience may be granted for the Certificate in Fundamentals of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Admitted students are responsible for ensuring that they have the prerequisites for all courses they take in the Certificate Program. Grade Requirements Students must receive a minimum grade of C in each course and have an overall GPA of 3.0 or better to earn a certificate. Continuation for a Master’s Degree All Santa Clara University graduate courses applied to the completion of a certificate program earn graduate credit that may also be applied toward a graduate degree. Students who wish to continue for such a degree must submit a separate application and satisfy all normal admission requirements. The general GRE test requirement for graduate admission to the master’s degree will be waived for students who complete a certificate program with a GPA of 3.5 or better.

EMGT students take core courses in organizational behavior, project management, systems engineering, finance, and marketing, augmented by additional courses in management and leadership. In parallel, students design a Technical Stem program to advance their knowledge in an advanced engineering discipline and round out their education with an Enrichment Experience. The combination of business and graduate-level engineering coursework prepares students for leadership roles in technologically sophisticated companies. Master Of Science Program Requirements Admission to the Engineering Management and Leadership Program is open to those students who hold an undergraduate or graduate degree in engineering, mathematics, computer science, or engineering physics. The undergraduate degree must be from a four-year engineering program substantially equivalent to Santa Clara University’s. Students holding undergraduate degrees other than bioengineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering must be prepared to select technical stem courses from these disciplines as listed in the Graduate Engineering Bulletin. In addition, the GRE is required for all students who do not have at least two years of working experience in the United States. Requirements Students are required to complete a minimum of 46 quarter units to complete the master’s degree, following these guidelines: Engineering Management Core (20 units) Required Courses (10 units):EMGT 255, 322, 330, 352, and 380 Leadership (2 units): select from EMGT 269, 285, 324, 349, 373, or 395 Project, Program, and Product Management (2 units): select from EMGT 296, 307, 333, 335, 338, 345, or 358 Operations/Innovation Management (2 units): select from EMGT 253, 289, 292, or 323 Electives (4 units): choose any 2 EMGT courses Technical Stem (18 units) A focused set of courses from Graduate Engineering departments; see guidelines and restrictions below Enrichment Experience (8 units) Graduate Core: one course each from “Emerging Topics in Engineering” and “Engineering and Society” Additional Courses: can be satisfied by any combination of a) one or more technical electives, b) additional classes from Graduate Core, and c) Cooperative Education courses (ENGR 288/289) Technical STEM Courses Engineering Management and Leadership students are required to create a focused, coherent program of studies within a field of engineering. The following list areas of focus by department, which can be used as guidelines for developing the Technical Stem program. Bioengineering: Biomolecular Engineering/Biotechnology; Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering; Microfluidics/Biosensors and Imaging; Computational or Translational Bioengineering Civil, Environmental, and Sustainable Engineering: Structural Engineering; General Civil Engineering; Construction Engineering and Management Computer Science and Engineering: Data Science; Internet of Things; Software Engineering; Information Assurance; Multimedia Processing; Computer Networks; Computer Architecture and Systems Electrical and Computer Engineering: Power Systems and Control; RF and Applied Electromagnetics; Signal Processing; Digital Systems; Communications Mechanical Engineering: Aerospace Engineering; Dynamics and Controls; Materials Engineering; Mechanical Design; Robotics and Mechatronic Systems; Thermofluids Power Systems and Sustainable Energy: Interdisciplinary Technical Stem programs can be created to pursue areas of interest within engineering management. For example, the following program would be applicable to Industrial Engineering and/or Operations Research. Probabilistic Modeling/Optimization: AMTH 210, 211, 245, 246, 362, 364, 370, 371 (optional: ELEN 235) Mathematical Finance option: substitute AMTH 367 for 2 of the above Network option: substitute ELEN 211 and/or 330 for 1 or 2 of the above Machine Learning option: substitute COEN 240 or 281 for 1 or 2 of the above; or ELEN 520, 521 Courses for the Technical Stem of Engineering Management and Leadership are selected from the graduate course listings in the Graduate Bulletin. However, not all graduate classes listed in the bulletin are considered technical in terms of fulfilling the technical stem requirements. This is especially the case of ENGR courses. In addition, there are other limitations, some of which are listed below. Therefore, it is important that students complete a program of studies in their first term, to make sure all of the courses they select will fulfill the degree requirements. • All courses applied to the Engineering Management and Leadership degree must be graded courses—no P/NP courses are allowed. • Undergraduate courses cross-listed with graduate course numbers do not apply unless the student registers with the graduate course number. • Graduate seminars in other departments such as ELEN 200, COEN 400, MECH 261, MECH 297 are not applicable. • COEN 485 Software Engineering Capstone is not applicable to the technical stem unless students complete three one-quarter consecutive sessions beginning in the fall quarter. • BIOE 210, COEN 288, and ENGR 245, 261, 271, 272, 273, 288, 289, 293, 302, 303, 304, 306, 330, 332, 334, 336, 338, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 349, and 350 do not count toward the technical stem. • Engineering Management and Leadership students are allowed to enroll in one unit of Independent Study or Directed Research under the direction of a full-time faculty member in the respective engineering department. Any additional units will not be counted toward graduation. • New courses are often developed and offered during the academic year that are not listed in this bulletin. It is important that students check with their advisor prior to enrolling in those courses to make sure they will count toward their degree. All of the requirements for the engineering management and leadership degree must be completed within a six-year timeframe. In addition to the overall 3.0 GPA graduation requirement, engineering management and leadership degree candidates must earn a 3.0 GPA in those courses applied to their technical stem and a 3.0 GPA in their engineering management course stem. All courses in which a student is enrolled at Santa Clara are included in these calculations. A completed program of studies for Engineering Management and Leadership degree candidates must be submitted to the chair of the Department of Engineering Management and Leadership during the first term of enrollment to ensure that all courses undertaken are applicable to the degree. Students who take courses that have not been approved for their program of studies by both the department chair and the Graduate Programs Office do so at their own risk, as they may not be counted toward completion of the degree. A maximum of nine quarter units (six semester units) of graduate-level coursework may be transferred from other accredited institutions at the discretion of the student’s advisor provided they have not been applied to a previous degree. However, in no case will the minimum units taken in the Department of Engineering Management and Leadership be fewer than 16. Extension classes, continuing education classes, professional development courses, or classes from international universities are not accepted for transfer credits. Note: International students or students not fluent in the English language should enroll in one or more of the following courses prior to enrolling in advanced courses in engineering management: • EMGT 270 Effective Oral Technical Presentations • EMGT 272 Effective Written Technical Communications II • EMGT 318 Strategies for Career and Academic Success (for foreign-born technical professionals) Engineering Management and Leadership Five-Year Program The School of Engineering offers qualified Santa Clara University undergraduates the opportunity to earn both a Bachelor of Science degree in their technical discipline and a Master of Science degree in Engineering Management and Leadership in five years. This is an excellent path to continue technical education while learning the essential skills required to manage technical projects and people. The degree program is open to students in bioengineering, civil engineering, computer science engineering, electrical and computer engineering, mechanical engineering, and software engineering. The application fee and GRE General Test requirement are waived for students completing their undergraduate B.S. degree in the technical disciplines listed above who have a minimum GPA of 3.0 in their technical major. Students are required to apply no later than the end of their junior year. Upon notification of acceptance into the Engineering Management and Leadership Five-Year Program, students may begin taking graduate-level courses in the fall quarter of their senior year. The maximum number of graduate units allowed as an undergraduate in this program is 20. Students in this program will receive a B.S. degree after satisfying the standard undergraduate degree requirements. Students will then be matriculated to the Engineering Management and Leadership M.S. program and must then fulfill all requirements for the M.S. degree. NOTES B.S. degrees (for those who are graduating seniors) must be posted by September 1 to allow the student progression in their graduate career. Undergraduate students must submit “Permission to Take Graduate Course” form to be correctly registered for graduate courses. All coursework applied to the M.S. degree must be at the 200 level or above and not applied to any other degree. Course numbers below 200 indicate undergraduate courses, numbers of 200 and above indicate graduate courses. Students may take courses assigned both undergraduate and graduate numbers (same title used for both numbers) only once as an undergraduate or graduate student. Students must register with the graduate course number in cross-listed courses to apply the course to an M.S. degree. Students who are entering this program should meet with their Engineering Management and Leadership advisor at the end of their junior year to develop a program of studies to ensure that all graduate courses they plan to take are applicable to the Engineering Management and Leadership M.S. degree.

"},"chapter-20-student-conduct-code.html":{"url":"chapter-20-student-conduct-code.html","title":"Chapter 18: Student Conduct Code","keywords":"","body":"Chapter 18: Student Conduct Code Statement Of Responsibilities And Standards Of Conduct All members of the University community have a strong responsibility to protect and maintain an academic climate in which the fundamental freedom to learn can be enjoyed by all and where the rights and well-being of all members of the community are protected. To this end, certain basic regulations and policies have been developed to govern the conduct of all students as members of the University community. Copies of the Student Handbook, which includes the Student Conduct Code, and information about the policies and procedures regarding the student judicial system are available from the Office of Student Life and at www.scu.edu/osl/student-conduct/. The goal of Santa Clara University is to provide students with a general education so that they will acquire knowledge, skill, and wisdom to deal with and contribute to contemporary society in constructive ways. As an institution of higher education rooted in the Jesuit tradition, the University is committed to creating and sustaining an environment that facilitates not only academic development but also the personal and spiritual development of its members. This commitment of the University encourages the greatest possible degree of freedom for individual choice and expression, with the expectation that individual members of the community will: Be honest. Demonstrate self-respect. Demonstrate respect for others. Demonstrate respect for the law and University policies, procedures, and standards; their administration; and the process for changing those laws, policies, procedures, and standards. In keeping with this commitment, this Statement of Responsibilities and Standards of Conduct and related policies and procedures have been formulated to guarantee each student’s freedom to learn and to protect the fundamental rights of others. There can be no rights and freedoms if all who claim them do not recognize and respect the same rights and freedoms for others. In addition to the laws of the nation, the State of California, and the local community, the University administration has established policies, procedures, and standards deemed necessary to achieve its objectives as a Catholic, Jesuit university. All members of the Santa Clara community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with the goals of the institution and to demonstrate respect for self, others, and their property. Students living off campus are members of this community, and as such are representatives to the community at large. In this regard, students living off campus maintain an equal measure of accountability to the values and expectations of all members of this community as identified in the Student Conduct Code. Whether living in or traversing through the neighborhood, or parking in the street, students are expected to adhere to the same high standards of conduct and behavior that are consistent with the students’ developing role as responsible and accountable citizens, and that reflect well upon the Santa Clara University community. All members of the University community have a strong responsibility to protect and maintain an academic climate in which the fundamental freedom to learn can be enjoyed by all and where the rights and well-being of all members of the community are protected. The University reserves the right to review student conduct that occurs on and off campus when such behavior is inconsistent with this expectation and the Student Conduct Code. The following acts subject students to disciplinary action: Engaging in any form of academic dishonesty, such as plagiarism (representing the work or ideas of others as one’s own without giving proper acknowledgment), cheating (e.g., copying the work of another person, falsifying laboratory data, sabotaging the work of others), and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context. Illegal use, possession, or distribution of drugs. The use or possession of equipment, products, or materials that are used or intended for use in manufacturing, growing, using, or distributing any drug or controlled substance.

Judicial Records Policy When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files. If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the severity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integrity violations. Allegations Outside a Course If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved. Student Conduct Records Policy The Office of Student Life maintains a hard copy file and a digital record of a student’s conduct history. Conduct records are educational records, and are thereby subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the University’s Student Records Policy. The conduct record is confidential and is only shared internally with University officials, in instances when the student grants permission to release the record, or there is what FERPA defines “an educational need to know” basis for the request. The conduct record is maintained throughout the student’s enrollment and thereafter, as indicated below. A student’s conduct record will only be released from the hard copy file to a person or party external to the University, if the student has granted permission, where the disclosure of the record is permissible under the provisions of FERPA, or where the University is required to do so by law. The digital copy of the conduct record will only be released to an external person or party where the University is required to do so by law. Retention of Hard Copy of Conduct Records The hard copy file of a student’s entire conduct history is kept for a minimum of one (1) academic year beyond the academic year in which the date of the last violation of the Student Conduct Code occurred. When a student commits a violation of academic integrity, the hard copy file is retained for the remainder of a student’s academic career. The files of any student who has received one or more of the following sanctions will be maintained for three (3) academic years beyond the academic year in which the student’s tenure in his/her current degree program at the University has ended: Removal from University housing Disciplinary probation Deferred suspension Suspension The conduct record of a student who has been expelled will be maintained for seven (7) years beyond the academic year in which the student’s tenure at the University has ended The University reserves the right to change this policy at any time at its sole discretion.

The time, place, and manner of exercising speech on campus are subject to regulations adopted by the University administration. Orderly conduct, noninterference with University functions or activities, and identification of sponsoring groups or individuals are required. Outdoor sound amplification will be permitted only with explicit approval of the Vice Provost for Student Life or designee. (Refer to “Amplification of Sound.”) Members of the faculty, academic departments, staff, administrative offices, or student organizations registered by authorized student government bodies may invite non-University speakers to address meetings on campus. Student groups that have not been registered by authorized student government bodies may not invite non-University speakers to address meetings on campus. If there would likely be extensive public notice or controversy associated with the presence of any speaker on campus, prior notice should be given to the head of the University Marketing and Communications, in the case of likely inquiries from external constituencies of the University or media; and to the Director of Campus Safety Services in the case of possible protest or disruption. Except for unusual circumstances, the notice should be at least one week before the meeting or event is to occur. The presence of a guest speaker on the campus of Santa Clara University does not necessarily imply approval or endorsement by the University of the views expressed by the guest speaker or by anyone else present at the event. The person or organization sponsoring a speaker around whom there would likely be extensive public notice or controversy is responsible for including the above statement in its advertisement, announcements, and news releases. If deemed appropriate, the University administration may also require the above statement be read at the beginning of the event. Whenever the University administration considers it appropriate in furtherance ofeducational objectives, it may require either or both of the following: That the meeting be chaired by a person approved by the University administration Any invitation to a non-University speaker extended by a chartered student organization, member of the faculty, staff, academic department, or administrative department may be rescinded only if the President, or his authorized designee, determines, after appropriate inquiry, that the proposed speech will constitute a clear and present danger to the orderly operation or peaceful conduct of campus activities by the speaker’s advocacy of such actions as: Willful damage or destruction, or seizure of University buildings or other property Disruption or impairment of, or interference with, classes or other University activities Physical harm, coercion, intimidation, or other invasion of the rights of University students, faculty, staff, or guests Violation of law Other disorder of a violent or seriously disruptive nature Liability and Property Insurance Except by expressed arrangement with the University, the University’s insurance does not cover students’ liability or students’ personal property. Students may wish to seek the services of their personal insurance agent to arrange for such coverage. Student Parking Parking on campus requires a valid parking permit at all times.

The University condemns and will not tolerate such harassment or discrimination against any employee, student, visitor, or guest on the basis of any status protected by university policy or law and upholds a zero tolerance policy for sexual violence and sexual misconduct. The University will take prompt and effective corrective action including, where appropriate, disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or expulsion. The University may implement interim measures in order to maintain a safe and non-discriminatory educational environment. Additionally, it is the University’s policy that there shall be no retaliation against a person for alleging discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct, cooperating with an investigation, or participating in an informal or formal resolution procedure. The Office of Equal Opportunity & Title IX is responsible for monitoring the University’s compliance with federal and state nondiscrimination laws, assisting with all aspects of investigating and resolving reported violations of Policy 311: Prevention of Unlawful Discrimination, Unlawful Harassment and Sexual Misconduct. The Director of Equal Opportunity & Title IX is also designated as the ADA/504 Coordinator responsible for coordinating efforts to comply with federal and state disability laws and regulations. The University encourages those who have witnessed or experienced any form of discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct to report the incident promptly, to seek all available assistance, and to pursue informal or formal resolution processes as described in this policy. Inquiries regarding equal opportunity policies, the filing of grievances, or requests for a copy of the University’s grievance procedures covering discrimination and harassment complaints should be directed to: Belinda Guthrie, Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IXOffice of Equal Opportunity and Title IXSanta Clara University425 El Camino Real Loyola Hall, Suite 140Santa Clara, CA 95050(408) 554-4113bguthrie@scu.edu ** A person may also file a complaint within the time required by law with the appropriate federal or state agency. Depending upon the nature of the complaint, the appropriate agency may be the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal Office for Civil Rights (OCR), or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). Title IX And Americans With Disabilities Act Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\"), 20 U.S.C. §1681 et seq., is a Federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities. Santa Clara University is committed to providing an environment free from discrimination based on sex and provides a number of resources and services to assist students, faculty, and staff in addressing issues involving sex discrimination. Under Title IX, discrimination on the basis of sex can include sexual harassment or forms of sexual violence, such as rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual exploitation, and stalking also prohibited by University Policy. Inquiries regarding the University's equal opportunity and nondiscrimination policies may be directed to the Director for the Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX who serves as the University's designated Title IX Coordinator and ADA/504 Coordinator, and Affirmative Action Officer.

Americans with Disabilities Act / Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Santa Clara University, in compliance with state and federal laws and regulations including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA) does not discriminate on the basis of disability in administration of its education-related programs and activities. The University is committed to providing individuals with disabilities including those with learning disabilities, ADHD, chronic health conditions, traumatic brain injuries, hearing impairments, physical disabilities, psychological disorders, visual impairments, and other health impairments equal access to academic courses, programs, activities, services and employment opportunities, and strives in its policies and practices to provide for the full participation of individuals with disabilities in all aspects of University life. For information concerning policies and procedures for students with disabilities, see the Office of Accessible Education (OAE) website, https://www.scu.edu/oae/. Students with disabilities who are registered with the OAE office may be qualified to receive accommodations, auxiliary aids or services based on supporting documentation. To register with OAE, contact the Director at 408-554-4109 or by email at oae@scu.edu. Faculty and staff should contact Human Resources for information on how to request employee disability-related accommodations, auxiliary aids or services, https://www.scu.edu/hr/. Students, faculty, and staff who believe they have been subjected to unlawful discrimination on the basis of disability, or have been denied access to services or accommodations required by law, should contact the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/. Drug-Free Policies It is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University’s activities. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace even if it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct. The unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and campus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clara premises where the activities of the University are conducted. Violations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. The program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and students. New staff employees are given a copy at New Employee Orientation. New faculty employees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation. The program is reviewed at least biennially by the Office of Student Life, Affirmative Action Office, and the Department of Human Resources. Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy Purpose Statement Santa Clara University is committed to providing an environment free of gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual violence and assault, relationship (dating and domestic) violence, and stalking. The University provides resources and reporting options to students, faculty, and staff to address concerns related to gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct prohibited by Title IX and University policy, and, through training and education, works to prevent its occurrence. The University seeks to provide a consistent, caring, and timely response when sexual and gender-based misconduct occurs within the University community. When the University becomes aware of allegations of sexual misconduct, it will take prompt and effective action. This action may include an initial assessment of safety and well-being, implementing interim remedies at no cost to the complainant for protection and support, discussing how the complainant wishes to proceed, initiating an investigation, and identifying appropriate avenues for resolution. The University’s response will be overseen by the EEO and Title IX Coordinator. The University’s Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy applies to all students, faculty, and staff, and includes any individual regularly or temporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or serving in an official capacity at Santa Clara University (including volunteers and contractors). The policy applies to both on-campus and off-campus conduct and to online actions that have a potential or actual adverse impact on any member of the University community, or which substantially interfere with a person’s ability to participate in University activities, or which could affect a substantial University interest or its educational mission. Policy Statement on What Constitutes Consent The University adheres to California’s definition of affirmative consent for sexual activity. “Affirmative consent” means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Under this definition, “No” always means “No.” “Yes” means “Yes” only if it is a clear, knowing, and voluntary consent to any sexual activity. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent. Fully informed consent means that a person understands the details of a sexual interaction (who, what, when, where, why, and how). It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in that activity. Consent can be given by words or action, but non-verbal consent is not as clear as talking about what a person does or does not want sexually. Consent to some form of sexual activity cannot be automatically taken as consent to any other form of sexual activity. Silence--without actions demonstrating permission--cannot be assumed to show consent. Consent is also not voluntary if forced or coerced. Coercing a person into sexual activity violates the University’s policy in the same way as physically forcing someone into sexual activity. Because alcohol or drug use can impair the capacity to consent, sexual activity while under the influence of alcohol or drugs raises questions about consent. It shall not be a valid excuse that the accused (hereafter “respondent”) believed that the reporting party (hereafter “complainant”), affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the accused knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity. Reporting Options There are several ways to report an incident of gender-based discrimination, sexual misconduct, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking. • For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime, students should call the City of Santa Clara Police Department: dial 911 or call Campus Safety Services: dial (408) 554-4444. • Students wishing to seek confidential assistance may do so by speaking with professionals who have the privilege of maintaining confidentiality except in extreme cases of immediacy of threat or abuse of a minor. Confidential resources include on- and off-campus mental health counselors, health service providers, advisors available through the University’s Violence Prevention Program, local rape crisis counselors, domestic violence resources, and members of the clergy and chaplains. • Students may report incidents and seek support from University officials, including the Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, Office of Student Life, Office of Accessible Education, and Campus Ministry. These University resources are required to report incidents to the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX coordinator, who will oversee the investigation and resolution process. At the time a report is made, a complainant does not have to decide whether or not to request disciplinary action. For more information about reporting, response, and adjudication, please see the University’s Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy or contact: Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX CoordinatorBelinda Guthrie425 El Camino Real, Loyola Hall, Suite 140Santa Clara CA 95050(408) 554-4113bguthrie@scu.edu**** or the Wellness Center852 Market Street(408) 554-4409 Computing and Electronic Resources Policy The computing and other electronic resources at SCU are provided solely for the support of students and employees in the pursuit of their scholarly or required academic activities, and for conducting the business of the University. General guidelines for use of computing, communication, and electronic resources on campus are based upon principles of etiquette, fairness, and legality. In using these resources at SCU, community members are expected to be respectful of other individuals’ ability to enjoy equal access to the resources, refrain from malicious or annoying behavior, take reasonable and responsible measures to protect confidential/sensitive information and abide by state and national laws, including those related to intellectual property and copyright. When you join the SCU community, you are provisioned with credentials (IDs and passwords) that allow you access to a wide variety of University resources. These credentials should never be shared with others. More details are available in the University’s Network and Communications Policies and Guidelines, accessible at https://www.scu.edu/is/technology-policies-procedures-and-standards/ or available from Information Services. Smoke-Free and Tobacco-Free Policy Santa Clara University has adopted a smoke-free and tobacco-free policy on the University campuses in Santa Clara and Berkeley. All University faculty, staff, students, and visitors are covered by this policy. In addition, all persons using University facilities are subject to this policy. The term “smoking” means inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying of any lighted or heated tobacco product, as well as smoking substances other than tobacco, or operating electronic smoking devices and other smoking instruments. “Tobacco product” means all forms of tobacco, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, electronic smoking devices, and all forms of smokeless tobacco. “Tobacco-related” means the use of a tobacco brand or corporate name, trademark, logo, symbol, motto, or advertising message that is identifiable with the ones used for any tobacco product brand or company which manufactures tobacco products. We encourage all students to take responsibility and inform all visitors of this policy. Any community member may request a smoker to move off campus and those that do not comply can be reported to Campus Safety. Any questions regarding this policy can be answered by Campus Safety Services or the Office of Student Life. Policy for Withdrawal for Health Reasons Students may experience an illness, injury, or psychological condition, herein referred to as a health condition, which significantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely in their roles as students. In these instances, time away from the University for treatment and recovery can restore functioning to a level that will enable them to return to the University. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the procedures for student withdrawals from the University for reasons of health and safety. The University has designated four categories relating to enrollment status. They differ according to who initiates the action, whether it is voluntary or not, and the re-enrollment procedures. Students who withdraw under this policy are strongly encouraged to either purchase or continue purchasing the tuition insurance plan. The Vice Provost for Student Life or designee, in consultation with the appropriate mental and medical health professionals and other staff as deemed necessary, is responsible for the implantation of this policy.
