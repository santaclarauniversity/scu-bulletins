Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remitting payment. Information on a student’s account cannot be provided to any third-party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees</span><span> </span><span>by the published term payment deadline. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to pre-pay for their enrollment. </span><span class=" gdbold">Registered students who do not formally withdraw from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their account, as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment.

Please note that a bank may reject a fund transfer if it exceeds a specific amount. Check with your bank about daily limits to prevent returned payment transactions. Payers are able to make electronic check payments without incurring a transaction fee. Payments made by electronic check will be subjected to a 7-day calendar hold.</span></p><h3 id="h.wikom2jkt60a"><span class=" gdbold">Payment by Mail</span></h3><p><span>Payment for student account charges is accepted by mail utilizing the University’s cash management service lockbox. Please enclose a copy of the billing statement with your paper check or cashier’s check made payable to Santa Clara University and mail both items to: SCU Payment Processing, P.O. Box 550, Santa Clara, CA 95052-0550.

Payments made by paper check will be subjected to a 10-day calendar hold. The OneStop Office is not able to initiate any form of electronic payment. However, there are computer kiosks located in the OneStop Office for the convenience of students and their payers who wish to make electronic payments. The University does not accept credit cards as payment for student account charges.  </span></p><h3 id="h.kcody38dz7ov"><span class=" gdbold">International Payment by Wire Transfer</span></h3><p><span>International students may submit payment quickly and securely through </span><span>Workday.</span><span> Authorized Payers and other third-party payers can make payments by accessing the following link: </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://scu.flywire.com">scu.flywire.com</a></span><span>. Students are able to benefit from excellent exchange rates and payment can usually be made in the student’s home currency. </span></p><p><span></span></p><h3 id="h.ihjj56hkl2f"><span class=" gdbold">Payment Plans</span></h3><p><span>Students currently enrolled at SCU may be eligible to enroll in a monthly payment plan to assist with budgeting needs. There is a $40 non-refundable enrollment fee per term and students must have a US bank account to enroll in the term plan. The first payment along with the enrollment fee is due upon enrollment and all subsequent payments will be processed automatically each month thereafter. Plans are subject to rebalancing based on changes in enrollment and/or financial aid. Participants must enroll each term; there is no automatic re-enrollment. The online monthly payment plan can be accessed by logging into Workday and selecting the Make a Payment link. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar’s Office website: </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="http://www.scu.edu/bursar/">www.scu.edu/bursar/</a></span><span>.</span></p><h2 id="h.ugjpze5rala7"><span class=" gdbold">Delinquent Payments</span></h2><p><span>If by the due date, all charges on a student’s account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student’s account and an account hold will be placed on the student’s account. The institution reserves the right to also require students with repeated instances of late payments to prepay for future enrollment. </span><span> If a student's prior-term payment history shows at least 2 consecutive terms of late payments, a registration hold may be placed on the account that would require prepayment with guaranteed funds for a minimum of three consecutive terms before the pre-payment registration hold is lifted. </span><span>A hold on a student’s account prevents the release of diplomas or certificates, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University.</span></p><p><span>Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recovering the debt owed to the University. All unpaid balances referred to an outside collection agency will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default in accordance with California state law. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and reasonable attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University. Returning students whose balances were previously referred[RS1]  to an external collection agency due to a delinquent account will be required to prepay for future enrollment.</span></p><h2 id="h.a4l57psxyypt"><span class=" gdbold">Billing Disputes</span></h2><p><span>If a student wishes to dispute any charge on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar’s Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar’s Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the disputed charge appeared.</span></p><p><span>Communication should include the student’s name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress. However, all other charges need to be paid by the payment deadlines. If the disputed amount is deemed to be invalid, then an adjustment will be made on the student’s account. If the amount in question is found to be valid, payment must be submitted to the Bursar’s Office immediately upon notification.</span></p><h2 id="h.cyynwe3m72ka"><span class=" gdbold">Refund Payments</span></h2><p><span>Refunds will be processed only for student accounts reflecting a credit balance. The refund request process will begin after the end of the late registration period. A refund will not be processed based on anticipated aid. All financial aid must be disbursed on to a student’s account before a refund is processed. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that all necessary documentation is completed and submitted to the Financial Aid office so that aid can be disbursed properly and in a timely fashion. Payment received by personal check will have a 1</span><span>0</span><span>-calendar day hold before a refund can be issued; electronic check payments require a 7-calendar day hold. Credits from overpayments on student accounts will remain on the account for future charges or refunded to the original payer or payment method. Payments by wire transfer will be returned via the same method.  For information on the Tuition Refund process and policies, please visit the Bursar’s Office website: </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.scu.edu/bursar/refund/.">Refunds</a></span></p><h3 id="h.j5113an3g5z"><span class=" gdbold">Fall, Winter, and Spring Quarters</span></h3><p><span>Graduate students who drop courses or formally withdraw from the University during fall, winter, or spring term will receive a tuition refund in accordance with the following:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_6-0 start"><li><span>By the end of the first week of classes – 100% tuition refund, less any applicable fees</span></li><li><span>By the end of the second week of classes – 50% tuition refund, less any applicable fees</span></li><li><span>By the end of the third week of classes – 25% tuition refund, less any applicable fees</span></li><li><span>After the third week of classes – zero tuition refund </span></li></ul><h3 id="h.jnmivilyte0v"><span class=" gdbold">Summer</span></h3><p><span>Students who drop courses or withdraw from the University during the summer session term will receive a tuition refund in accordance with the following:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_5-0 start"><li><span>By the end of day of the second scheduled class meeting – 100% tuition refund, less any applicable fees</span></li><li><span>By the end of day of the third scheduled class meeting – 50% tuition refund, less any applicable fees</span></li><li><span>No tuition refund after these days</span></li><li><span>Courses taught in an asynchronous manner meet M, W, </span><span>and </span><span>R for tuition refund purposes. </span></li></ul><h3 id="h.fg0xnlnet5nx"><span class=" gdbold">Saturday/Sunday Courses/Off Cycle Courses</span></h3><p><span>Students enrolled in a weekend course in which the first class meeting is after the first week of the term must provide written notification, to the Graduate </span><span>Engineering</span><span> Programs Office, of their intent to withdraw or drop any weekend/</span><span>off-cycle</span><span> course(s).

Once the amount has been determined by the school, the information is sent to the Financial Aid Office for processing. The Financial Aid Office awards the aid and sends an email notification to the student’s SCU Gmail address only, informing them of their financial aid package and/or any aid revision. Students will be able to see their school scholarship award on e-campus. The award amount will also appear as “anticipated aid” on the student’s account to alleviate the assessment of holds/late fees from the Bursar’s Office. Generally, financial aid is disbursed to the student’s account ten days before the start of classes each term. If eligible, the Bursar’s Office will issue refunds to students reflecting credit balances after the first week of class.</span></p><h3 id="h.lvklavqxg02u"><span class=" gdbold">Cancellation of Financial Aid and Return of Funds </span></h3><p><span>Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are subject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal financial aid funds governed under Title IV.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of </span><span>disbursable</span><span> aid for that period that the student has earned. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to the state or University financial aid programs and/or the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received federal Title IV assistance:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_3m8e1hb95pnf-0 start"><li><span>Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans) </span></li><li><span>Subsidized Federal Direct Loans</span></li><li><span>Federal Direct Grad PLUS Loans</span></li><li><span>Federal PELL Grants for which a return is required</span></li><li><span>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants for which a return is required </span></li><li><span>TEACH Grants for which a return is required</span></li><li><span>Iraq and Afghanistan Grants for which a return is required</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><p><span></span></p></body>
