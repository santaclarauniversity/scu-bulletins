At approximately one-third of the units required for a master’s degree, the certificate is designed to be completed in a much shorter period of time. These certificate programs are appropriate for students working in industry who wish to update their skills or for those interested in changing their career path.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><h2 id="h.rzsip97h0tkg"><span class=" gdbold">Interdisciplinary</span></h2><h3 id="h.evjau3og37l4"><span class=" gdbold">Certificate in Frugal Innovation </span></h3><p><span class=" gditalic">Advisor:</span><span> Dr. Aleksandar Zecevic </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Over the past two decades, global trends have been forcing businesses to adapt to growing consumer bases in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which are in desperate need of low-cost and high-quality solutions to the challenges that they face. The importance of these new “economic realities” is underscored by the fact that emerging markets are expected to exceed 50% of the world’s GDP in 2017 (according to IMF estimates). In order to excel professionally in such an environment, engineers will have to be equipped with the knowledge and skill sets to appropriately define, design, and implement solutions that are not merely a “stripping down” of Western products to meet the rising demand. Industry, particularly in Silicon Valley, is becoming increasingly aware of this fact and has begun to move toward a ‘Triple Bottom Line’ approach to business, which integrates environmental, societal, and financial considerations. The Certificate in Frugal Innovation is designed to give students the ability and the tools to adapt to this new model, and to expand their understanding of the impact that engineering has on society.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>This program is suitable for working professionals in a wide variety of engineering disciplines. To enroll, students must have a B.S. in Engineering from an accredited institution and should maintain a GPA of at least 3.000 in order to receive the certificate.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Program Requirements</span></p><p><span>The Certificate in Frugal Innovation entails a minimum of 16 units of coursework. It consists of an eight-unit Core and a set of electives that are organized into two groups. Students are required to take four units from Group A and another four from Group B, as described below. </span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Required Core Classes (8 units)</span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_9-0 start"><li><span>ENGR/GREN 336 Engineering for the Developing World (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ENGR/GREN 338 Mobile Applications and Instrumentation for Emerging Markets (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ENGR/GREN 340 Distributed and Renewable Energy for the Developing World (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ENGR/GREN 341 Innovation, Design and Spirituality</span></li></ul><p><span class=" gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Elective Group A (4 units)</span></p><p><span></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_5-0 start"><li><span>ENGR/GREN 304 Building Global Teams (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ENGR/GREN 342 3D Print Technology and Society (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ENGR 349 Ethical Decision Making for Technology Leaders  (2 units)</span></li></ul><p><span class=" gditalic"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold gditalic">Elective Group B (4 units)</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li><span>CENG 219 Designing for Sustainable Construction (4 units)</span></li><li><span>CSEN 389 Energy Efficient Computing (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ECEN 280/MECH 287 Introduction to Alternative Energy Systems (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ECEN 288/CSEN 282 Energy Management Systems (2 units)</span></li><li><span>ENGR/GREN 302 Managing in the Multicultural Environment (2 units)</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><h3 id="h.668dae3ce73"><span class=" gdbold">Renewable Energy Certificate </span></h3><p><span class=" gditalic">Advisor: </span><span>Dr. Maryam Khanbaghi</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Renewable energy is the fastest-growing sector in California and brings together principles and practices from engineering, environmental science, and economics.

The intent is to help equip professionals in Silicon Valley with the knowledge that will help them advance in their present careers or enter the renewable energy field. To enroll in this certificate, an applicant should have a B.S. in Engineering from an accredited school and should maintain a grade point average of 3.000. As with most certificates in the Graduate School of Engineering, the requirement is 16 quarter units.

The certificate program is designed for working professionals, who would like to deepen their understanding in disciplinary subjects and apply the knowledge to real engineering problems. One can receive a certificate in Mechanical Engineering by taking 16 units of Mechanical Engineering graduate courses with a minimum GPA of 3.00 and a grade of C or better in each course. Candidates for a certificate in a specific concentration area must take at least 8 units of core courses from the concentration area, which is listed under the section “Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering” in</span><span> Chapter 14: Department of Mechanical Engineering</span><span> of this Bulletin. Applicants must have completed an accredited bachelor’s degree program in Mechanical Engineering or a closely related field of engineering.
