# Engineering at Santa Clara

The undergraduate programs leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering were first offered at Santa Clara University in 1912 and these programs were later accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology in 1937. Since that time, the following degree programs have been added: Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, General Engineering, and Web Design and Engineering; Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Engineering Management and Leadership, Mechanical Engineering, Power Systems and Sustainable Energy, and Robotics and Automation; Engineer’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering; and Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. In addition, the School of Engineering offers a variety of certificate programs, as well as an Open University program.

**SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING MISSION STATEMENT**

The mission of Santa Clara University’s School of Engineering is to prepare diverse students for professional excellence, responsible citizenship, and service to society. The engineering school does this through:

* Distinctive academic programs that are designed to produce engineers who approach their profession with competence, conscience, and compassion
* Broadly educated faculty, who model and encourage the notion of lifelong learning
* Scholarly activities that create new knowledge and advance the state of the art of technology
* Interactions with professional societies and companies in Silicon Valley and beyond
* Service activities that benefit our diverse constituencies and humanity in general

**SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING VISION**

Grounded in the Jesuit approach to education, the School of Engineering’s vision is to educate the whole person to solve society’s most complex problems. Our vision is an engineering community that inspires and develops engineering leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion—entrepreneurial thinkers who will build a more just, humane, and sustainable world.
