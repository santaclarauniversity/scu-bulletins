# Chapter 12: Department of Engineering

_Coordinator:_ Dr. Aleksandar Zecevic

The Graduate Core is one of the distinguishing features of the Master’s program at Santa Clara University. Because of its breadth and interdisciplinary nature, the Core requires courses that transcend departmental boundaries, and address questions that relate to the societal impact of engineering, as well as ways in which this impact can be shaped. We offer a wide range of such courses, which are designated with the prefix ENGR \(to emphasize the fact that they belong to the category of General Engineering\).

### **Course Descriptions**
