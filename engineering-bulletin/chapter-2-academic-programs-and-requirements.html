In certain cases, the department may accept publication in the proceedings of an appropriate conference.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Students who have earned a master’s degree from Santa Clara University must file a new application (by the deadline) to continue work toward the engineer’s degree. A program of studies for the engineer’s degree should be developed with the assistance of an advisor and submitted during the first quarter of enrollment.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2 id="h.g7y6v2jhowu"><span class=" gdbold">Doctor of Philosophy Program</span></h2><p><span></span></p><p><span>The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is sought by those engineers who wish to engage in research and discover new knowledge in a specific area within their field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a dissertation based on that research, and a program of advanced studies consisting of engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences. The student’s work is directed by the degree-conferring department, subject to the general supervision of the School of Engineering. The school grants Ph.D. in bioengineering, computer science and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering.</span></p><h3 id="h.jk5ap6o9j80"><span class=" gdbold">Preliminary Examination</span></h3><p><span>The preliminary examination shall be written and/or oral and shall include subject matter deemed by the major department to represent sufficient preparation in depth and breadth for advanced study in the major. </span></p><p><span>Students who have completed the M.S. degree requirements and have been accepted for the Ph.D. program should take the preliminary examination as soon as possible but not more than two years after beginning the program.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Students currently studying at Santa Clara University for a master’s degree who are accepted for the Ph.D. program and who are at an advanced stage of the M.S. program may, with the approval of their academic advisor, take the preliminary examination before completing the M.S. degree requirements.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Only those students who pass the preliminary examination shall be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. The preliminary examination may be repeated only once and only at the discretion of the </span><span>doctoral</span><span> advisor and department.</span></p><h3 id="h.i4xckgh9ipjn"><span class=" gdbold">Doctoral Advisor</span></h3><p><span>It is the student’s responsibility to obtain consent from a full-time </span><span>tenure-stream</span><span> faculty member in the student’s major department to serve as </span><span>their </span><span>prospective advisor.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>It is strongly recommended that Ph.D. students find a doctoral advisor before taking the preliminary examination. After passing the preliminary examination, Ph.D. students must have a doctoral advisor before the beginning of the next quarter following the preliminary examination. Students currently pursuing a master’s degree at the time of their preliminary examination should have a doctoral advisor as soon as possible after being accepted as a Ph.D. student.</span></p><p><span>The student and the advisor </span><span>with recommendations from the student’s doctoral committee </span><span> develop a complete program of studies for coursework and research.

The committee consists of at least five members, each of which must have earned a doctoral degree in a relevant field of engineering or a related discipline. The committee must include the student’s advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from </span><span>another</span><span> appropriate acade</span><span>mic department at Santa Clara University. The student’s Ph.D. committee looks at the proposed research and the prior background of the student to determine whether or not there are specific courses that must be added as requirements. </span><span>The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the </span><span>dissertation</span><span>. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and </span><span>dissertation</span><span> itself meet with the approval of all committee members.</span></p><h3 id="h.4vqefuycwl85"><span class=" gdbold">Residence</span></h3><p><span>The Ph.D. degree is granted on the basis of academic achievement. The student is expected to complete a minimum of 72 units of graduate credit beyond the master’s degree with an overall GPA of 3.000 or better. Of these, 36 quarter units may be earned through coursework, independent study</span><span>,</span><span> and directed research, and 36 through the </span><span>dissertation.</span><span> Deviation from this distribution must be approved by the student’s doctoral committee and must not be more than six units. All Ph.D. </span><span>dissertation</span><span> units are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. A maximum of 18 quarter units (12 semester units)</span><span> of credit for work beyond a master’s level, which have not</span><span> </span><span>previously been used</span><span> for the completion of another degree, may be transferred from any accredited </span><span>institution</span><span> at the discretion of the student’s advisor.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gditalic">Please note</span><span class=" gditalic">: Only classes with assigned grades of C- or higher will count toward the completion of the Ph.D. degree. </span></p><h3 id="h.x12sjfi3b5yg"><span class=" gdbold">Comprehensive Examination and Admission to Candidacy</span></h3><p><span>After completion of the formal coursework approved by the doctoral committee, the student shall present his/her research proposal for a comprehensive oral examination on the subject of his/her research work. The student should make arrangements for the comprehensive examination through the doctoral committee. A student who passes the comprehensive examination is considered a degree candidate.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The comprehensive examination normally must be completed within four years from the time the student is admitted to the doctoral program. Th</span><span>is</span><span> examination may be repeated once, in whole or in part, at the discretion of the doctoral committee.</span></p><h3 id="h.4uak4e2si5f8"><span class=" gdbold">Dissertation Research and Defense</span></h3><p><span>The period following the comprehensive examination is devoted to research for the </span><span>dissertation</span><span>, although such research may begin earlier. After successfully completing the </span><span>dissertation</span><span> research, the student must pass an oral defense examination on</span><span> their</span><span> research</span><span>.</span><span> This exam is conducted by the doctoral committee and whomever they appoint as examiners. The </span><span>complete dissertation</span><span> must be made available to all examiners one month prior to the examination.

This examination presentation is open to all faculty members and students of Santa Clara University. Following the public presentation, a closed session for further questions includes only the doctoral committee, an</span><span>d </span><span>only members of the doctoral committee may vote on </span><span>the </span><span>successful completion of the de</span><span>fense</span><span>.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><h3 id="h.5w979k35cvb"><span class=" gdbold">Dissertation and Publication</span></h3><p><span>At least one month before the degree is conferred, the candidate must submit one copy of the final version of the </span><span>dissertation</span><span> to the department.</span><span> </span><span>The </span><span>dissertation</span><span> will not be considered accepted until a </span><span>copy signed by all committee members has been submitted to the library</span><span> and one or more refereed articles based on it are accepted for publication in a professional or scientific journal approved by the doctoral committee. The quality of the refereed journal must be established by satisfying one of two criteria: (1) the refereed journal should have an impact factor of at least 1.0 or (2) prior to submitting the candidate’s work to a refereed journal, written approvals of the journal’s quality and suitability should be obtained from the candidate’s advisor, the doctoral committee, the department chair, and the </span><span>graduate program office.</span><span> This written approval must be kept in the candidate’s file.</span><span> The final version of the dissertation must be filed with the library.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><p><span>The requirements for the doctoral degree in the School of Engineering have been made to establish the structure in which the degree may be earned. The University reserves the right to evaluate the undertakings and the accomplishments of the degree candidate in total and award or withhold the degree as a result of its deliberations.</span></p><h3 id="h.30j0zll"><span class=" gdbold">Time Limit for Completing Degrees</span></h3><p><span>All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee. Extensions will be allowed only if approved by the</span><span> Associate </span><span>Dean</span><span> </span><span>of </span><span> Graduate Studies </span><span>in consultation with the Graduate Program Leadership Council.</span></p><h3 id="h.6n4knsbt2e5r"><span class=" gdbold">Non-Enrollment Period</span></h3><p><span>Ph.D. students are required to enroll in at least one unit for the fall, winter, and spring quarters and </span><span>also</span><span> for their final graduating quarter. Those who do not wish to enroll must submit a leave of absence or a withdrawal request through their workday student portal. Leave of absence or withdrawal request must be submitted by the end of the first week of the quarter. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"><div class="bttooltip">Please Note: Students who miss one or more quarters and fail to submit the appropriate requests will be discontinued automatically and may have to reapply to the Ph.D. program. Readmission is not guaranteed.</div></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><h2 id="h.z8hpqavro8l"><span class=" gdbold">The Industrial Track Ph.D.</span></h2><p><span>In addition to our regular Ph.D. program, Graduate </span><span>Engineering</span><span> also offers an “industrial track” for working professionals as an option to facilitate the collaboration between academia and industry and </span><span>allow the sponsoring company to be specifically included in research guidance</span><span>. </span><span>Details are as follows:</span></p><p><span></span></p><ol class="lst-kix_d56aqb5wchji-0 start" start="1"><li><span>The topic of the research should be coordinated with the needs of the candidate’s employer and must be agreed upon by all parties. This topic must have a component that is publishable and presentable in open forums. If necessary, a collaborative research agreement will be enacted to indicate the rights of the School and the industrial partner.</span></li><li><span>As a part of the application process, candidates must submit a letter of support from their employer. This letter should contain a pledge of financial support and must identify a co-advisor within the company. The co-advisor shares responsibilities for guiding the candidate’s research with a full-time faculty advisor. This person is also expected to be a member of the doctoral committee.</span></li><li><span>Students who opt for this “industrial track” are responsible for meeting all requirements for the Ph.D. The awarded degree will be the same for all students, regardless of the track that they choose to pursue.</span></li></ol><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><h2 id="h.gxz8u6d25mtd"><span class=" gdbold">Open University Program</span></h2><p><span></span></p><p><span>Engineers who wish to update their skills or learn new technologies without pursuing a specific degree may enroll in the School of Engineering’s Open University program. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p id="h.gjdgxs"><span>If a student from the Open University program is accepted into a degree program, </span><span class=" gdbold">a maximum of 16 units may apply toward the degree </span><span>if the courses are in the same discipline to which the student is accepted. The general GRE test requirement for admission to the master’s degree program will be waived if the student has completed a program-specified set of required courses and has earned a GPA of 3.5 or higher in those courses. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Open University students who are considering enrolling in the master’s program should be aware that each specialization has its own </span><span>specific</span><span> requirements, and that the number of “free electives” is very limited. Such students are therefore strongly encouraged to choose their classes in consultation with a faculty advisor from the very beginning.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Students should remember, however, that all coursework taken at SCU, whether as a degree-seeking student or an Open University </span><span>student, becomes</span><span> a part of the student’s academic history.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class=" gditalic"><div class="bttooltip">Please Note: Santa Clara University does not issue F-1 visas to applicants who wish to enter directly into the open university program.</div></span></p></body>
