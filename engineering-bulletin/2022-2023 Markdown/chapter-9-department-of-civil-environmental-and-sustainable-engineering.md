### Overview

The Department of Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering offers graduate programs in the areas of structural engineering, general civil engineering, and construction engineering and management. The focus of the educational effort is on modeling, analysis, and practical methods used to design and construct structures and other civil engineering-related infrastructure systems. As such, many of the courses offered are beneficial to civil and construction engineers, and construction managers interested in advancing their knowledge and enhancing their technical skills.

### Degree Program

The civil, environmental, and sustainable engineering graduate program at Santa Clara University is designed to accommodate the needs of students interested in advanced study. An individual may pursue the degree of Master of Science (M.S.) as either a full-time or part-time student through a customized balance of coursework, design projects, and directed research. Program participants are also required to supplement their technical work with coursework on project management topics addressed in the graduate engineering core curriculum.

The structural engineering (SE) track provides students with an opportunity to effectively link theory and practice by completing a combination of analysis- and design-oriented courses. Options within the structural engineering track allow students to either complete a capstone design project or a faculty-directed research investigation. This program track is aimed at individuals looking to prepare for a career in consulting structural engineering or in structural plan review.

The general civil engineering (GCE) track has been configured to provide students with additional analytical and design coursework in several infrastructure-related areas of civil engineering. This track could potentially include work in water resources engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering, and geotechnical engineering. A capstone design or research project with a required sustainability component is available to integrate these different elements. This track is geared toward individuals preparing for a career in land development, municipal engineering, or public works.

The construction engineering and management (CEM) track is designed to prepare students with skills and knowledge required to effectively manage time, cost, safety, quality, and sustainability requirements of construction projects. The track has some flexibility to accommodate students with interests in practical applications or research investigations. This track is designed for students with career objectives of managing building or substantial construction projects for contractors, owners, and developers.

The water and environmental engineering (WEE) track prepares students to engage in advanced engineering analysis, design, and research to solve complex issues by quantifying risks related to water supply, flooding, and contamination and designing systems to treat contamination to protect public health and the environment. This track is ideal for people interested in working on these topics with public agencies, consulting firms, nonprofits, or pursuing further graduate work.

### Master of Science in Civil Engineering

To be considered for admission to the graduate program in Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering, an applicant must meet the requirements outlined in the [Admissions section](chapter-3-admissions.md) of the bulletin, with the following additional criteria:

Applicant’s undergraduate degree must be:

* A civil engineering B.S. from an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)-accredited four-year program or its equivalent, or
* A B.S. in a relevant technical area for the proposed graduate track. In such cases, applicants must take sufficient additional courses beyond the 46-unit minimum to ensure coverage of prerequisite material for the required classes. For example, applicants pursuing the water/environmental track would need CENG 41, CENG 141, CENG 143, plus any missing differential equations, physics, and chemistry prerequisites to those. These additional classes are subject to the same grade requirements as described elsewhere in the bulletin.

Applicant’s undergraduate record must show:

* An overall grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.75 (based on a 4.0 maximum scale).

In very rare cases, applicants not meeting this may be admitted with a requirement to successfully complete a defined course of studies within a limited time period.

See the [Academic Information section](chapter-5-academic-information.md) of this bulletin for details on transferring credit for courses taken at other institutions.

Upon acceptance to the graduate program in Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering, a student will be required to select a graduate advisor (full-time faculty member) from within the Department of Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering. The student’s advisor will be responsible for approving the student’s course of study. Any changes to a student’s initial course of study must have the written approval of the student’s advisor.

To qualify for the degree of Master of Science in Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering, the students must complete a minimum of 46 quarter units, including elective and required core courses, within the School of Engineering. Required and elective courses for structural engineering, general civil engineering, and construction management tracks are provided below. Students may elect to do a design project or research project. Students undertaking a design project would investigate applying a new technique or method in the analysis or design of a structure, system, or element, and this must be documented in a design report. Students undertaking a research project would develop a new technique, method, component, or design criteria, and this must be documented in a conference or journal publication, or report.

Course requirements for the SE, GCE, CEM and WEE tracks are summarized in the following table:

Units are shown in parentheses: x/y indicates x-unit course with y-unit lab. No more than 6 units from CENG 293, 295, and 297 may be used to satisfy degree requirements. Taking Required Technical Course(s) that repeat previously taken course(s) is discouraged; in such cases, Elective Technical course(s) may be substituted. In rare occasions, program plans may deviate from these requirements with Department approval.

† CENG 205 & 206 may be replaced by MECH 251.

\*Replace with CENG 246 if a timber design course was taken previously.

\*\*Courses listed in the required section not taken to satisfy that requirement may be used as technical electives. An advisor may approve selected upper-level undergraduate classes including those listed (no more than 12 units total) that do not duplicate course content of graduate courses in the program of studies.

^ May simultaneously satisfy a Graduate Core requirement, but course credit may only count once toward the degree. Balance of credits shall be made of technical electives.

Upon the approval of the student’s advisor, alternative elective courses may be taken. Courses used to satisfy the 46-unit minimum total for the Master of Science in Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering degree cannot be used to satisfy any previous undergraduate degree program requirement. This includes cross-listed undergraduate courses at Santa Clara University and/or their equivalent courses at other institutions. Where required courses in the SCU graduate Civil, Environmental, and Sustainable Engineering program have been completed prior to graduate-level matriculation at SCU, additional elective courses may be required to satisfy the minimum unit total requirement as necessary.
