### BILLING AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES

Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures. Students may designate a third party (e.g., parent, family member, spouse) to be an Authorized Payer for the purpose of reviewing student accounts, billing information, and remitting payment on the student’s behalf. However, it is ultimately the student’s responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the published deadlines.&#x20;

Students receive monthly bills electronically that are accessible through eCampus. A billing notification will be sent to the student’s SCU Gmail account and to the email address of any Authorized Payer. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remitting payment. Information on a student’s account cannot be provided to any third-party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University.

Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees by the published term payment deadline. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to pre-pay for their enrollment. **Registered students who do not formally withdraw from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their account, as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees.**

Additional information, including detailed instructions on Santa Clara’s billing and payment procedures, is located at the website: [BURSAR WEBSITE](http://www.scu.edu/bursar)

**Payment by Electronic Check**&#x20;

A student or Authorized Payer can make online payments by processing a fund transfer directly from their _personal_ checking or savings account through a third-party vendor's website accessible via the University eCampus system or SCU Pay site. Please note that a bank may reject a fund transfer if it exceeds a specific amount. Check with your bank about daily limits to prevent returned payment transactions. Payers are able to make electronic check payments without incurring a transaction fee.&#x20;

**Payment by Mail**&#x20;

Payment for student account charges is accepted by mail utilizing the University’s cash management service lock box. Please enclose a copy of the billing statement with your paper check or cashier’s check made payable to Santa Clara University and mail both items to: SCU Payment Processing, P.O. Box 550, Santa Clara, CA 95052-0550.

**Payment in Person**&#x20;

Payments for student account charges may be made in person by cashier’s check, money order, cash or check at the OneStop Office in the Admissions & Enrollment Services Building.. There are computer kiosks located in the OneStop Office for the convenience of students and their payers who wish to make electronic payments. The University does not accept debit or credit card payments for student account charges.

**International Payment by Wire Transfer**&#x20;

International students may submit payment quickly and securely through eCampus. Authorized Payers and other third-party payers can make payments by accessing the following link: [https://payment.flywire.com/pay/payment](https://payment.flywire.com/pay/payment). Students are able to benefit from excellent exchange rates and payment can usually be made in the student’s home currency.

**Payment Plans**

Students currently enrolled at SCU may be eligible to enroll in a monthly payment plan to assist with budgeting needs. There is a $40 non-refundable enrollment fee per term and students must have a US bank account to enroll in the term plan. The first payment along with the enrollment fee are due upon enrollment and all subsequent payments will be processed automatically each month thereafter. Plans are subject to rebalancing based on changes in enrollment and/or financial aid. Participants must enroll each term; there is no automatic re-enrollment. The online monthly payment plan can be accessed by logging into eCampus and selecting the Financial Account Tile. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar’s Office website: [www.scu.edu/bursar/.](http://www.scu.edu/bursar/)

### DELINQUENT PAYMENTS&#x20;

If all charges on a student’s account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, enrollment in the payment plan, or loan disbursement by the payment deadline, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student’s account and a hold will be placed on the student’s record. A hold on a student’s record prevents the release of diplomas and certifications, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval, are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue ten percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default in accordance with California state law. Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recovering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be paid in full **prior to** a student re-enrolling at the University.

### BILLING DISPUTES

If a student wishes to dispute any charge on their billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to Santa Clara University, Bursar’s Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar’s Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the item in question appeared. Communication can be made by telephone but doing so will not preserve the student’s rights.

Communication should include the student’s name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress; all other items not in question must be paid by the due date. If the amount in question is found to be correct, payment must be submitted to the Bursar’s Office immediately upon notification.

### REFUND PAYMENTS

Refunds will be processed only for student accounts reflecting a credit balance. The refund request process will begin after the end of the late registration period. A refund will not be processed based on anticipated aid. All financial aid must be disbursed on to a student’s account before a refund is processed. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure that all necessary documentation is completed and submitted to the Financial Aid office so that aid can be disbursed properly and in a timely fashion. Payment received by personal check will have a 14-calendar day hold before a refund can be issued; electronic check payments require a 7-calendar day hold. Credits from overpayments on student accounts will remain on the account for future charges or refunded to the original payer. Payments by wire transfer will be returned via the same method.

Tuition insurance may be purchased to cover tuition charges for diagnosed medical or mental health related withdrawals that occur after the first week of the term.

Santa Clara University degree students who withdraw from the University or who are administratively withdrawn from the University after the third week of the term due to a qualifying financial hardship may be eligible for an allocation from the student hardship fund for 25 percent of the tuition charges for that term. Qualifying financial hardships include (1) death, disabling injury, medical emergency, (2) loss of job by an independent student, (3) medical or other emergency involving a dependent of an independent student, and (4) student deployment for active military duty. The Vice Provost for Student Life or designee, in consultation with the Financial Aid Office, will determine qualifying financial hardships and any allocation from the student hardship fund.

Santa Clara reserves the right to change tuition, room and board, fees, or other costs, to modify its services, or change its programs at any time. In addition, no refunds of tuition, room and board, fees or other costs will be made because of curtailed services resulting from strikes, acts of God, civil insurrection, riots or threats thereof, changed economic conditions, national emergency, or other causes beyond the control of Santa Clara University.&#x20;

### TUITION INSURANCE PROTECTION

Students and families may protect themselves against financial loss due to an unexpected withdrawal from the University by purchasing tuition insurance coverage. The University has partnered with A.W.G. Dewar Inc., to provide an optional insurance plan. This plan is designed to protect from loss of funds paid for tuition should it be necessary to completely withdraw from the University during the term for diagnosed medical or mental health reasons. Plan enrollment is available annually or quarterly. Enrollment must be completed prior to the first day of the quarter. Information on the tuition insurance plan can be found at: [www.collegerefund.com](http://www.collegerefund.com) and available on the Bursar’s Office website at: [www.scu.edu/bursar/tuitionprotection](http://www.scu.edu/bursar/tuitionprotection).

### FINANCIAL AID&#x20;

Students must be enrolled at least part-time status (4 units) to receive Federal financial aid.&#x20;

**California State Graduate Fellowships**&#x20;

State graduate fellowships are awarded to California residents pursuing a recognized graduate or professional degree who intend to pursue teaching as a career and who have not completed more than four quarters of full-time graduate work as of October 1. Selection is based on state manpower needs, academic performance, and financial need. Applicants should apply using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is available at the website: [www.fafsa.ed.gov/](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa).&#x20;

**Loans**

Students applying for aid may find the most advantageous method of financing their education through loan programs. Among those available to students of the School of Engineering are the Federal Perkins Loan and Federal Stafford Loans through the School as Lender Program. Applicants should apply using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is available at the website: [www.fafsa.ed.gov/](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa).

{% hint style="info" %}
_Please Note: A student must be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen to qualify for federal sources of financial assistance._&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Deadlines**&#x20;

The Financial Aid Office has established deadlines for consideration of the various programs it administers. All students requesting financial aid from the University should contact the Financial Aid Office at the earliest possible date to request specific deadline information and appropriate application materials. Files completed later than February 1 for new recipients and March 2 for current recipients will receive consideration on a funds-available basis. All financial aid deadlines are posted on the Financial Aid website: [www.scu.edu/financialaid](http://www.scu.edu/financialaid).

**Veterans and Veterans' Dependents Assistance**&#x20;

Santa Clara University has been certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 percent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill®), Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®), and Yellow Ribbon. Individuals interested in attending under any of the veteran assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar.

GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at [http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill. ](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill)

**Teaching and Research Assistantships**&#x20;

The School of Engineering offers a limited number of teaching and research assistantships providing up to eight units of tuition and, in some cases, a modest stipend. For further information, students are encouraged to contact their faculty advisor or their academic department.&#x20;

**University-Awarded Aid**

Individual graduate schools may grant their students a specific amount of financial aid, per term, in the form of Santa Clara University school scholarships. Once the amount has been determined by the school, the information is sent to the Financial Aid Office for processing. The Financial Aid Office awards the aid and sends an email notification to the student’s SCU Gmail address only, informing them of their financial aid package and/or any aid revision. Students will be able to see their school scholarship award on e-campus. The award amount will also appear as “anticipated aid” on the student’s account to alleviate the assessment of holds/late fees from the Bursar’s Office. Generally, financial aid is disbursed to the student’s account ten days before the start of classes each term. If eligible, the Bursar’s Office will issue refunds to students reflecting credit balances after the first week of class.&#x20;

**Cancellation of Financial Aid and Return of Funds**

Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are subject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal financial aid funds governed under Title IV.

Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned.

A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled.

All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to the state or University financial aid programs and/or the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received federal Title IV assistance:&#x20;

* Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans)&#x20;
* Subsidized Federal Direct Loans&#x20;
* Federal Direct Grad PLUS Loans&#x20;
* Federal PELL Grants for which a return is required&#x20;
* Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants for which a return is required&#x20;
* TEACH Grants for which a return is required&#x20;
* Iraq and Afghanistan Grants for which a return is required
