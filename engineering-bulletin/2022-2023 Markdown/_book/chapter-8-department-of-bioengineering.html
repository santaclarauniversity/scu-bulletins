<h3 id="overview-"><strong>Overview</strong> </h3>
<p>Bioengineering is the fastest-growing area of engineering and holds the promise of improving the lives of all people in straightforward and diverse ways. Bioengineering focuses on the application of electrical, chemical, mechanical, and other engineering principles to understand, modify, or control biological systems. As such, the curriculum teaches principles and practices at the interface of engineering, medicine and the life sciences. The Department of Bioengineering currently offers an M.S. degree program with a focus on biodevice engineering, biomaterials and tissue engineering, and biomolecular engineering.</p>
<p>A number of faculty offer research projects to bioengineering students that are engaging and involve problem-solving at the interface of engineering, medicine and biology.</p>
<p>Dr. Yan&#x2019;s research interests center on bioimaging, image and signal analysis, and AI-assisted medical diagnosis. Notable achievements of her lab include the development of new imaging modalities to study laryngeal dynamics and function, with associated analytical methods for the classification of laryngeal pathologies.</p>

<p><em><strong>BIOE 378. Advanced Biomaterials</strong></em> </p>
<p>The objective of this course is to examine the range of new biomaterials potentially applicable to medical and biotechnology devices. The content will focus on chemistry and fabrication of polymeric biomaterials, surface properties, nano-scale analytical tools, effects of the biological environment and interaction with cells and tissues. In teams of 2 to 4, students will prepare and orally present a design study for a solution to a medical problem requiring one or more biomaterials, using tissue engineering and regenerative approaches. Students should be familiar with or prepared to learn medical, anatomical and physiological terminology. Written assignments are an annotated bibliography drawn from research literature on the topic of the design study and an individually-written section of the team&#x2019;s report. Material from lectures and student presentations will be covered in short quizzes and a final examination. (2 units) </p>
