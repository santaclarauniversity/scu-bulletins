Instituted at the request of engineering students, it states: All students taking courses in the School of Engineering agree, individually and collectively, that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in examinations or other coursework that is to be used by the instructor as the basis of grading. Students and teachers cooperate and share responsibilities under the code. Instructors are responsible for making clear what aid is permissible and for using procedures that minimize temptations to violate the code. Students are responsible for behaving honorably; for actively ensuring that others, as well as themselves, uphold the code; and for being responsive to violations. Information on faculty or student reporting of violations can be found on the university academic integrity web resources at</span><span> https://www.scu.edu/academic-integrity. </span></p><h2 id="h.h2pg7vr1tkd"><span class=" gdbold">Classes</span></h2><p><span>For convenience for working professionals, classes are offered in the early morning, 7:10 – 9:00 A.M., and Monday/Wednesday/Friday evenings, 5:25–7:15 PM and 7:25– 9:15 P.M., Tuesday/Thursday evenings  5:40–7:30 P.M. and 7:40 – 9:30 P.M. with some weekend offerings. Two-unit courses meet one day per week, three-unit courses may meet one or two days per week, and four-unit courses meet two days per week. All students are expected to attend the first class meeting of the quarter. Failure to do so can result in an administrative withdrawal from the course by the professor during the first week of the quarter.</span></p><h2 id="h.co0p566jximn"><span class=" gdbold">Standards of Scholarship</span></h2><p><span>Only courses in which the student has earned assigned grades of C- or higher contribute to the unit total for the Master’s, Engineer’s, or Ph.D. degree or certificates. The student must earn a minimum 3.000 cumulative grade point average (GPA). Only credits, not grade points, may be transferred from other institutions. </span></p><p><span>Students who have not met the minimum cumulative 3.000 GPA after completing 16 units will be placed on an academic warning. Students who do not meet the minimum cumulative GPA after being on an academic warning will be placed on academic probation. If a student is on academic probation for two consecutive active quarters they are eligible for dismissal. The student’s advisor and Department Chair will be notified about their GPA status. A dismissal decision by the program will be based on a departmental vote, which will be conducted at the request of the advisor and/or Department Chair, and with approval from the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs. Students who have been dismissed from the program may appeal to the Department Chair, and subsequently to the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies.</span></p><p><span>Although only classes with assigned grades of C- or higher will count toward the units required for certificates, M.S., Engineer, or Ph.D. degrees, the grades of all courses completed during the certificate, M.S., Engineer’s, or Ph.D. program are used to compute the cumulative grade point average (GPA). </span></p><p><span>Directed Research, Independent Study, and ENGR courses are not included in the student's major GPA. Only major subject courses will be calculated in the student’s major GPA. </span></p><h2 id="h.ohre1j66djmf"><span class=" gdbold">Grading System</span></h2><p><span>Grading is based on an A through F scale. </span><span>The grades B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes. The grade of A may only be modified by a (-). </span><span>Grade point values per unit are assigned as follows: </span><span class=" gdbold">A</span><span> = 4.0; </span><span class=" gdbold">A-</span><span> = 3.7; </span><span class=" gdbold">B+</span><span> = 3.3; </span><span class=" gdbold">B</span><span> = 3.0; </span><span class=" gdbold">B-</span><span> = 2.7; </span><span class=" gdbold">C+</span><span> = 2.3; </span><span class=" gdbold">C</span><span> = 2; </span><span class=" gdbold">C-</span><span> = 1.7; </span><span class=" gdbold">D+</span><span> = 1.3; </span><span class=" gdbold">D</span><span> = 1.0; </span><span class=" gdbold">D-</span><span> = 0.7. </span><span class=" gdbold">F</span><span>= 0. </span><span class=" gdbold">I</span><span> (incomplete), </span><span class=" gdbold">P</span><span> (pass), </span><span class=" gdbold">NP</span><span> (no pass), </span><span class=" gdbold">NS</span><span> (no show), and </span><span class=" gdbold">W</span><span> (withdrawn) are all assigned zero points. Unit credit, but not grade point credit, is awarded when the grade of P is assigned. </span></p><p><span>The University also uses the following marks: </span><span class=" gdbold">AUD</span><span> (audit), </span><span class=" gdbold">I</span><span> (incomplete), and </span><span class=" gdbold">N</span><span> (continuing work). No unit credit or grade point value is granted for any of these marks.</span></p><h2 id="h.522ydz5lz3zo"><span class=" gdbold">Non-graded Courses</span></h2><p><span>Seminar courses (with the exception of CSEN 400 and ECEN 200), are limited to a total of four units and must be approved by the student’s advisor. </span></p><h2 id="h.4u2g1ve02ed2"><span class=" gdbold">Incomplete Grades</span></h2><p><span>The mark of “I” (incomplete) may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the student’s control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the course instructor within three weeks of the beginning of classes in the next scheduled term (not the student’s next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, unless extraordinary circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University Registrar within the original three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quarters after the mark of “I” was assigned, excluding summer session. An incomplete that has not been completed within the specified deadline or has not received an approved extension will be converted to a grade of “F.”</span></p><h2 id="h.28laug500ae7"><span class=" gdbold">Continuing Work (N)</span></h2><p><span>The mark of “N” (continuing work) may be assigned by an instructor when course requirements span more than one term. When the course requirements are completed, the instructor assigns a standard grade. A student may not graduate and receive a degree with a mark of “N” on their academic record.</span></p><h2 id="h.euaqf7jjpgwy"><span class=" gdbold">No Show (NS)</span></h2><p><span>The mark of “NS” (no show) may be assigned by an instructor when a student never attends a class and does not drop the class. A mark of “NS” cannot be changed to any other grade or mark after it is assigned by the instructor. A mark of “NS” is included in the student’s academic record and appears on the student’s transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student’s grade point average. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mark of “NS” in a class.</span></p><h2 id="h.uchbsvyxlwyf"><span class=" gdbold">Audit (AUD)</span></h2><p><span>The mark of “AUD” is assigned when a student enrolls in a class on an audit basis. A mark of “AUD” cannot be changed to any other grade.</span></p><h2 id="h.tiu5cabb97r"><span class=" gdbold">Withdrawn (W)</span></h2><p><span>The mark of “W” is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements for dropping a class or withdrawing from the University. A mark of “W” cannot be changed to any other grade or mark. A mark of “W” is included in the student’s academic record and appears on the student’s transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student’s grade point average.</span></p><h2 id="h.fmq2pekx6gh0"><span class=" gdbold">Change of Grade</span></h2><p><span>The faculty instructor is solely responsible for assigning the grade in a course. All grades become final when they have been assigned and reported to the Office of the Registrar. A faculty member may report a correction of a final grade to the Office of the Registrar only if a clerical or procedural error was made in assigning, transmitting, or recording the original grade. A grade may not be changed as a result of re-evaluation, re-examination, or the submission of additional work after the term ends. Any grade change must have the approval of the department chair and the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. No grade may be changed after one year.</span></p><h2 id="h.yzogurxfh522"><span class=" gdbold">Auditing Courses</span></h2><p><span>A student may take courses with a grading basis of “audit” but the following should be kept in mind:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_5-0 start"><li><span>The current graduate tuition rate and fees will be charged.</span></li><li><span>No grade points or credit will be earned so the class cannot be counted toward the completion of a certificate, M.S., Engineer’s, or Ph.D. degree.</span></li><li><span>A student will need to register for the class, then send an email to the Director of Records requesting the grading basis be changed to “Audit”</span></li><li><span>The last day to request to audit a course is at the end of the first week of the quarter. </span></li></ul><p><span>Alumni can request to audit a course with a reduced tuition fee. Alumni will need to apply to the Open University program and must meet the application deadline to apply for an audit. Please contact the Director of Records for the alumni audit form. Anyone interested in this option is welcome to contact the graduate program office.  </span></p><h2 id="h.p2a0ppl9plqc"><span class=" gdbold">Repeating Courses</span></h2><p><span>A student may, with the permission of the department, repeat a course in which a grade of D+ or lower was received on the first attempt. </span><span>In such cases, the better grade of both the original and the repeated course is included in the calculation of the student’s grade point average, and units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Both grades remain on the student transcript.</span><span> </span><span>A course may only be repeated once.</span></p><h2 id="h.347gz9cx5dwp"><span class=" gdbold">Withdrawal from Courses</span></h2><p><span>Students may change their course registration as stated in the Academic Calendar. Withdrawal from any course is allowed up to the seventh Friday of the term. Before the end of the fourth week of the quarter, a withdrawal is not recorded on the transcript.  After the fourth week of the quarter, a withdrawal will be recorded as W on the transcript. After the seventh Friday of the quarter, a withdrawal is no longer possible.  Emergencies that qualify may be handled as an incomplete (I). International Students with an F-1 Visa should check with the Global Engagement Office to confirm if they are eligible to drop a course. </span></p><h2 id="h.mhci8upcqxau"><span class=" gdbold">Program of Studies </span></h2><p><span>During the first quarter of enrollment, a student in the M.S. degree program is required to meet with an academic advisor to complete a Program of Studies (POS) form. It is the student’s responsibility to contact their department or listed advisors. Here are the assigned advisors for the following departments</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_1b91phqy6hz9-0 start"><li><span class=" gdbold">Aerospace Engineering</span><span> - Mohammad Ayoubi (Program Advisor)</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Applied Mathematics</span><span> - Aaron Melman (Department Chair)</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Artificial Intelligence </span><span>- Yi Fang (Program Advisor)</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Bioengineering</span><span> - Please contact the department for available advisors.</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering</span><span> - Please contact the department for available advisors.</span></li><li><span class=" gdbold">Computer Science and Engineering</span><span> - The CSE department will send an email with your academic advisor information by the end of the first week of the quarter.

The POS must be signed by the advisor and submitted to the Graduate Engineering Programs Office before the end of the first quarter of enrollment. Failure to submit a new POS will result in a registration hold. Changes to the approved Program of Studies may be made at any time by submitting an updated POS form with the advisor’s signature to the Graduate Engineering Programs Office. The final POS form signed by the advisor must include all units, courses, and transfer credits, and must be submitted before the end of the student’s final quarter for graduation. </span></p><h2 id="h.ssrwlafv16bq"><span class=" gdbold">Courses Transferred from Santa Clara University</span></h2><p><span>Students admitted into the B.S./M.S. program may transfer up to 20 units of graduate-level courses (course numbers 200+)  that they completed as an undergraduate as long as those courses or units were not used to satisfy their undergraduate degree requirements. Courses requested for transfer credit must be listed under the unused registrations on the academic progress report on Workday. Any requested transfer course will need to be approved by the academic advisor and listed on the program of studies under the transfer credit section.
