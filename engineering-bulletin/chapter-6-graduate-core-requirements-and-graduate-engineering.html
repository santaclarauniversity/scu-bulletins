Note that some ENGR/GREN courses are not included as part of the graduate core but are designed to be elective courses that are accessible to and of interest to students from many engineering programs. This includes the Co-op Education Courses ENGR/GREN 289 and ENGR/GREN 389. The Graduate Core is one of the distinguishing features of the Master’s program at Santa Clara University. Because of its breadth and interdisciplinary nature, the Graduate Core requires courses that transcend departmental boundaries and address questions that relate to the societal impact of engineering, as well as ways in which this impact can be shaped. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The Graduate Core is required for all M.S. degree-seeking students in all departments and programs in the School of Engineering. The components that are associated with this requirement are designed to broaden the scope of the student’s knowledge and develop professional skills essential for operating effectively in a global environment including the ability to communicate clearly, to function on interdisciplinary and diverse teams, and to make ethically and socially responsible decisions.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>All core courses must be taken at SCU and transfer credit cannot be approved for core courses. B.S./M.S. students may start to take the core courses while they are undergraduate students.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>In order to fulfill the Graduate Core requirement, students must take one course selected from each of the following two areas:</span></p><p><span></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_rmafxtvfqabp-0 start"><li><span>Engineering and Society </span></li><li><span>Professional Development</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><p><span>Below are the lists of all classes approved for the graduate core in these two areas.
