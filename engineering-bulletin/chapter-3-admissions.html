<h3 id="program-details-">Program Details </h3>
<p><strong>B.S./M.S. Dual Degree Program (Current undergraduate SCU students)</strong> </p>
<p>The B.S./M.S. degree program allows current SCU undergraduate students to begin taking courses required for a master&#x2019;s degree before completing the requirements for bachelor degree. This B.S./M.S. program is based on a minimum GPA of 3.0 in your major. Upon notification of acceptance into the B.S./M.S. program, students may begin taking graduate-level courses in their senior year and a maximum of 20 units of graduate level coursework can be transferred into the graduate program as long as the units were not used toward the undergraduate degree.</p>
<p><strong>Open University</strong> </p>
<p>For those who want to update their skills and learn new technologies without the commitment of earning a graduate degree, Open University allows students to enroll in graduate-level classes. </p>
<ul>
<li>A maximum of 16 units may apply toward the degree if the courses are in the same discipline to which the student is accepted. The general GRE test requirement for admission to the master&#x2019;s degree program will be waived if the student has completed a set of required courses in the department to which they are applying and has earned a GPA of 3.5 or higher. </li>
<li><em>Note 1: Santa Clara University does not issue F-1 visas to applicants who wish to enter directly into Open University.</em> </li>
<li><em>Note 2: Open University students are not eligible to enroll in undergraduate classes.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Certificate Programs</strong> </p>
<p>Certificate programs provide an opportunity for continued learning and skills refreshment for professional practice at the graduate level. </p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the certificate program, students will complete 16-18 units of coursework. </li>
<li>All certificate units in the discipline may be applied toward a master&#x2019;s degree. Students who wish to pursue a Master&#x2019;s degree must submit a separate online application. The application fee will be waived for currently enrolled certificate students. The general GRE and TOEFL test requirement for graduate admission to the master&#x2019;s degree will be waived for students who complete a certificate with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher. </li>
<li><em>Note 1: Santa Clara University does not issue F-1 visas to applicants who wish to enter directly into the Certificate Program.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Master&#x2019;s Program</strong> </p>
<p>Our master&#x2019;s programs extend the breadth and depth of undergraduate knowledge leading to a professional work. Completion of the degree requires a minimum of 46 units. </p>
<p><strong>Ph.D. Degree</strong> </p>
<p>Our research-intensive Ph.D. program prepares students for careers in research and design.\
Ph.D. degrees are offered in the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. This is a full-time program. Students must complete a minimum of 72 units.</p>
<p><strong>Engineer&#x2019;s Degree Program</strong></p>
<p>This unique program is designed for the practicing engineer. Completion of the program requires a minimum of 46 units beyond the master&#x2019;s degree.</p>
<h3 id="admission-deferrals-">Admission Deferrals </h3>
<p>Any student who has been admitted and made a deposit to a degree program and wishes to defer their admission for the current academic year (the year listed in your acceptance letter) must submit a deferral form prior to the start of the quarter listed on the student&#x2019;s admission letter. If a student wishes to defer into the next academic year, they must submit a new application (please note: admission is not guaranteed and any previous enrollment deposit is non-refundable). Please email <a href="mailto:gradengineer@scu.edu" target="_blank">gradengineer@scu.edu</a> for the deferral form.</p>
