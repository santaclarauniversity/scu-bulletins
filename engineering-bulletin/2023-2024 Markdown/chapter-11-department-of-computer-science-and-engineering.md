## Overview

> “Computing sits at the crossroads among the central processes of applied mathematics, science, and engineering. The three processes have equal and fundamental importance in the discipline, which uniquely blends theory, abstraction, and design.” –1989 Task Force Report on the Core of Computer Science prepared by the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society.

The most successful graduates in the field of computing are those who understand computers as systems—not just the design of hardware or software, but also the relationships and interdependencies between them and the underlying theory of computation.

The department offers a variety of degree and certificate programs, including courses that cover the breadth of the discipline, from the engineering aspects of hardware and software design to the underlying theory of computation.

## Degree Programs

Students are required to meet with their advisors to define and file a program of study during their first quarter. In general, no credit is allowed for courses that duplicate prior coursework, including courses listed as degree requirements. Students should arrange adjustment of these requirements with their academic advisor when they file their program of study.

With the prior written consent of the advisor, master’s students may take a maximum of 12 units of coursework for graduate credit from selected senior-level undergraduate courses.

### Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering \(MSCSE\)

All students admitted to the MSCSE program are expected to already have competence in the fundamental subjects listed below, as required within an accredited program for a B.S. in Computer Science Engineering.. An applicant without such background \(but who has completed college level calculus and advanced programming\) may still be admitted, provided the deficiencies are corrected by coursework that is in addition to the normal degree requirements, and that is completed within the first year of graduate study. Alternatively, a student may take a similar course at another approved accredited institution. Online, continuing education, extension courses, and courses without a closed book exam are not accepted. The subjects and corresponding SCU courses that may be used to correct the deficiencies include:

1. Logic design COEN 21 or 921C

2. Data structures COEN 12 or 912C

3. Computer organization & assembly language COEN 20 or 920C or ELEN 33

4. Discrete math AMTH 240

5. Probability AMTH 210 

6. One of the following: Differential Equations \(AMTH 106\), Numerical Analysis \(AMTH 220, 221\), or Linear Algebra \(AMTH 245, 246\) 

7. One additional advanced programming course or one year of programming experience in industry.  


The SCU COEN and ELEN courses listed above and AMTH 106 are considered undergraduate-level and may not be used to satisfy the requirements for the M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. However, students who have satisfied item 6 above, but who have never studied numerical analysis, may use AMTH 220/221 as electives; students who have satisfied item 6 above, but who have never studied linear algebra, may use AMTH 245/246 as electives. Laboratory components are not required for the above courses.

#### Degree Requirements

1. Engineering Graduate Core- Enrichment Experience
   * Students must take a minimum of 8 units of the Graduate Core Enrichment Experience courses as described in [Chapter 4, Academic Information](chapter-4-academic-information.md).
2. MSCSE Core
   * COEN 210, 279, and 283 
   * Students who have taken one or more of these core courses or their equivalent must replace said course\(s\) with the advanced course equivalent \(COEN 313, 379, and/or 383\) or, with their advisor’s approval, replace said course\(s\) with elective\(s\).
3. MSCSE Electives
   * A student must take a minimum of 8 units of COEN 300-899 courses. CSE electives must be approved by the advisor.
4. Electives: Sufficient units to bring the total to at least 46. \(The maximum number of non-COEN graduate units allowed is 10 units, including those from the Engineering Graduate Core, and courses must be approved by the advisor.\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Please Note: Students wishing to do a thesis \(COEN 497\) should consult with their academic advisor regarding a modification of these requirements.

### Master of Science in Software Engineering \(MSSE\)

We are currently not accepting applications for the Master of Science in Software Engineering program. 

### Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science and Engineering

The Doctor of Philosophy \(Ph.D.\) degree is conferred by the School of Engineering primarily in recognition of competence in the subject field and the ability to investigate engineering problems independently, resulting in a new contribution to knowledge in the field. The work for the degree consists of engineering research, the preparation of a thesis based on that research, and a program of advanced study in engineering, mathematics, and related physical sciences. The student’s work is directed by the department, subject to the general supervision of the School of Engineering. See [Chapter 2, Academic Programs and Requirements](chapter-2-academic-programs-and-requirements.md), and [Chapter 3, Admissions](chapter-3-admissions.md), for details on admission and general degree requirements. The following departmental information augments the general requirements.

#### Preliminary Exam

A preliminary written exam is offered at least once per year by the School of Engineering as needed. The purpose is to ascertain the depth and breadth of the student’s preparation and suitability for Ph.D. work.

#### Faculty Advisor

The student and his or her advisor jointly develop a complete program of study for research in a particular area. The complete program of study \(and any subsequent changes\) must be filed with the Engineering Graduate Programs Office and approved by the student’s doctoral committee. Until this approval is obtained, there is no guarantee that courses taken will be acceptable toward the Ph.D. course requirements.

#### Doctoral Committee

After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of which must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University.

The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members. In addition, acceptance of publications with the student as the primary \(first\) author is required. More details are described in [Chapter 2, Academic Programs and Requirements.](chapter-2-academic-programs-and-requirements.md)

#### Time Limit for Completing Degree

All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee and approved by the dean of engineering in consultation with the Research Program Leadership Council \(RPLC\).

### Engineer’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering

The program leading to the engineer’s degree is particularly designed for the education of the practicing engineer. The degree is granted on completion of an approved academic program and a record of acceptable technical achievement in the candidate’s field of engineering. The academic program consists of a minimum of 46 units beyond the master’s degree. Courses are selected to advance competence in specific areas relating to the engineering professional’s work. Evidence of technical achievement must include a paper principally written by the candidate and accepted for publication by a recognized engineering journal prior to the granting of the degree. A letter from the journal accepting the paper must be submitted to the department chairperson. In certain cases, the department may accept publication in the proceedings of an appropriate conference.

Admission to the program will generally be granted to those students who demonstrate superior ability in meeting the requirements for their master’s degree. Normally, the master’s degree is earned in the same field as that in which the engineer’s degree is sought. Students who have earned a master’s degree from Santa Clara University must file a new application \(by the deadline\) to continue work toward the engineer’s degree. A program of study for the engineer’s degree should be developed with the assistance of an advisor and submitted during the first term of enrollment.

### Certificate Programs

Certificate programs are designed to provide intensive background in a narrow area at the graduate level. At roughly one-third of the units of a master’s degree program, the certificate is designed to be completed in a much shorter period of time. These certificate programs are appropriate for students working in industry who wish to enhance their skills in an area in which they already have some background knowledge. We are currently not accepting applications for certificate programs in Computer Science and Engineering.
