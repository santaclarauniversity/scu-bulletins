## Overview

Bioengineering is the fastest-growing area of engineering and holds the promise of improving the lives of all people in straightforward and diverse ways. Bioengineering focuses on the application of electrical, chemical, mechanical, and other engineering principles to understand, modify, or control biological systems. As such, the curriculum teaches principles and practices at the interface of engineering, medicine and the life sciences. The Department of Bioengineering currently offers an M.S. degree program with a focus on biodevice engineering, biomaterials and tissue engineering, and biomolecular engineering. 

A number of faculty offer research projects to bioengineering students that are engaging and involve problem-solving at the interface of engineering, medicine and biology. 

[Dr. Yan’s](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/yan-yuling/) research interests center on bioimaging, image and signal analysis, and AI-assisted medical diagnosis. Notable achievements of her lab include the development of new imaging modalities to study laryngeal dynamics and function, with associated analytical methods for the classification of laryngeal pathologies. 

[Dr. Zhang](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/zhang-jonathan/) is currently engaged in research on several NIH-funded projects spanning protein engineering to drug discovery. 

[Dr. Araci’s](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/araci-emre/) research goals are directed toward the development and application of novel microfluidic and optofluidic technologies for biology and medicine. His work is focused on two major areas: i\) implantable and miniaturized devices for telemedicine and ii\) single molecule protein counting.

[Dr. Asuri’s](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/asuri-prashanth/) research interests involve integrating tools and concepts from biomaterials engineering, biotechnology, and cell biology to explore the role of biomaterial properties such porosity, matrix stiffness, etc., on protein structure and function and in regulating cell fate. 

[Dr. Kim](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/kim-ashley/) investigates the application of integrated microfluidic systems for multiple uses in diagnostics as well as experimental science.

[Dr. Lu’s](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/lu-bill/) research focuses on medical translations of protein engineering that includes protein therapeutics and drug delivery as well as molecular sensor and imaging technology.

[Dr. Mobed-Miremadi’s](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/mobed-miremadi-maryam/) research interests are in the areas of mesoscience, specifically the interface of cellular engineering/chemical engineering, bio-device development based on membrane-based therapies and bio-fabrication.

## Degree Program

The bioengineering graduate program at Santa Clara University is designed to accommodate the needs of students interested in advanced study in the areas of medical devices/bioinstrumentation and molecular and cellular bioengineering. An individual may pursue the degree of Master of Science \(M.S.\), either as a full-time or part-time student, through a customized balance of coursework, directed research and/or thesis research. Students are also required to supplement their technical work with coursework on other topics that are specified in the graduate engineering core curriculum.

## Master of Science in Bioengineering

To be considered for admission to the graduate program in bioengineering, an applicant must meet the following requirements:

* A bachelor’s degree in bioengineering or related areas from an ABET accredited four-year B.S. degree program or it’s equivalent 
* An overall grade point average \(GPA\) of at least 3.0 \(based on a 4.0 maximum scale\)
* Graduate Record Examination \(GRE\)-general test 
* For students whose native language is not English, Test of English as a Foreign Language \(TOEFL\) or the International English Language Testing systems \(ILETS\) exam scores are required before application is processed

Applicants who have taken graduate-level courses at other institutions may qualify to transfer a maximum of nine quarter units of approved credit to their graduate program at Santa Clara University.

Upon acceptance or conditional acceptance, to the graduate program in bioengineering, a student will be required to select a graduate advisor \(full-time faculty member\) from within the Department of Bioengineering. The student’s advisor will be responsible for approving the student’s course of study. Any changes to a student’s initial course of study must have the written approval of the student’s advisor.

To qualify for the degree of Master of Science in Bioengineering, students must complete a minimum of 46 quarter units, including required core and elective courses, within the School of Engineering. Required and elective courses for the bioengineering programs are provided below. Students undertaking thesis work are required to engage in research that results, for example, in the development of a new method or approach solving a bioengineering related problem, or a technical tool, design criteria, or a biomedical application. This work should be documented in a journal publication, conference, or research report, and must also be included in a Master’s thesis. Alternatively, students may elect to take only courses to fulfill the requirement for the M.S. degree.
