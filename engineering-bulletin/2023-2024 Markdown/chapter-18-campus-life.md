# Chapter 17: Campus Life

Santa Clara students are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities as part of their total development. The primary educational objective in supporting student activities and organizations is to foster a community that is enriched by men and women of diverse backgrounds, wherein freedom of inquiry and expression enjoys high priority.

The following sections describe various aspects of student life and services.
