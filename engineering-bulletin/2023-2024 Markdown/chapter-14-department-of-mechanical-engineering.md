## Overview

The Department of Mechanical Engineering is dedicated to delivering up-to-date, high-quality courses across a broad range of the discipline to meet the needs of both part- and full-time graduate students. These courses are concentrated in five emphases: (1) dynamics and controls; (2) design and manufacturing; (3) mechanics and materials; (4) mechatronic systems engineering; and (5) thermofluids and energy. Educational efforts are channeled to expand the skills of prospective and practicing engineers, not only in understanding fundamentals but also in developing competence in analyzing engineering systems. The department offers graduate degrees at the master, engineer, and doctorate levels, as well as certificates.

## Master of Science Programs

An M.S. degree requires a minimum 46 units of study with an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher. The student must select one of the five areas of emphasis and develop a program of studies with an advisor. Courses taken to satisfy any particular requirement may be used to simultaneously satisfy additional requirements for which they are appropriate. Master of Science degrees must include the following:

* Engineering Core- Enrichment experience requirement as described in Chapter 6 (minimum of 8 units). Students must take a minimum of 4 units from at least two of the three areas:
  * Emerging Topics in Engineering,&#x20;
  * Engineering and Business/Entrepreneurship
  * Engineering and Society

The remaining 4 units can be accumulated by,&#x20;

a) taking one or more major technical electives,&#x20;

b) additional classes from the Graduate Core list,

c) cooperative education courses (Engr 288, Engr 289) or &#x20;

d) combining a, b, and c.

* Math requirement: 8 units composed of MECH 200 and 201, or MECH 202, and an approved two-course sequence or equivalent four-unit course in applied math
* Depth Requirement: 8 or more units depending on the chosen emphasis
* Breadth Requirement: 4 units in other emphases outside one’s chosen emphasis. No double dip is allowed.
* At least 28 units from graduate courses in mechanical engineering.
* All emphases offer a culminating experience, which can be pursued by taking MECH 290 (Graduate Research/Project) and/or MECH 299 (Master’s Thesis).  Up to 6 units of MECH 290 can be taken and counted toward the 46-unit requirement.  Those who write a thesis or publish an article in a peer-reviewed journal can take 6 more units of MECH 299. Some emphases may require the culminating experience.&#x20;

The student may take any additional graduate courses, as needed, offered by the School of Engineering to meet the minimum 46-unit requirement.

## Doctor of Philosophy Program

The Doctor of Philosophy degree is conferred by the School of Engineering in recognition of competence in the subject field and the ability to investigate engineering problems independently, resulting in a new contribution to knowledge in the field.

See the section on Academic Regulations for details on admission and general degree requirements. The following departmental information augments the general School requirements.

**Academic Advisor**

A temporary academic advisor will be provided to the student upon admission. The student and advisor must meet prior to registration for the second quarter to complete a preliminary program of studies, which will be determined largely by the coursework needed for the preliminary exam.

**Preliminary Exam**

A preliminary written exam is offered at least once per year by the School of Engineering as needed. The purpose is to ascertain the depth and breadth of the student’s preparation and suitability for Ph.D. work. Each student in mechanical engineering must take and pass an exam in mathematics as well as in two areas from the following list: Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, Strength of Materials, Dynamics, Design, Controls, Vibrations, Finite Element Analysis, Material Science, and Thermodynamics. The advisor must approve the student’s petition to take the exam. This exam should be taken within one year of starting the program.

**Doctoral Committee**

After passing the Ph.D. preliminary exam, a student requests his or her thesis advisor to form a doctoral committee. The committee consists of at least five members, each of which must have earned a doctoral degree in a field of engineering or a related discipline. This includes the student’s thesis advisor, at least two other current faculty members of the student’s major department at Santa Clara University, and at least one current faculty member from another appropriate academic department at Santa Clara University. The committee reviews the student’s program of study, conducts an oral comprehensive exam, conducts the dissertation defense, and reviews the thesis. Successful completion of the doctoral program requires that the student’s program of study, performance on the oral comprehensive examination, dissertation defense, and thesis itself meet with the approval of all committee members.

**Time Limit for Completing Degree**

All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years following initial enrollment in the Ph.D. program. This includes leave of absence/withdrawals. Extensions will be allowed only in unusual circumstances and must be recommended in writing by the student’s doctoral committee and approved by the dean of engineering in consultation with the Research Program Leadership Council.

## **Engineer’s Degree Program**

The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers an engineer’s degree program. Details on admissions and requirements are shown in the Academic Regulations section. Students interested in this program should seek individual advice from the department chair prior to applying.

## **Certificate Programs**

The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers a certificate in the five concentration areas (Design and Manufacturing; Dynamics and Controls; Mechanics and Materials; Mechatronic Systems Engineering; Thermofluids and Energy) as well as general mechanical engineering. The certificate program is designed for working professionals, who would like to deepen their understanding in disciplinary subjects and apply the knowledge toward real engineering problems. One can receive a certificate in Mechanical Engineering by taking 16 units of Mechanical Engineering graduate courses with a minimum GPA of 3.0 and grade above of C or better in each course. Candidates for a certificate in a specific concentration area must take at least 8 units of core courses from the concentration area, which is listed under the section “Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering”. Applicants must have completed an accredited bachelor’s degree program in Mechanical Engineering or a closely related field of engineering. Up to 16 units earned in a certificate can be transferred toward another advanced degree program at SCU if they are accepted to the M.S. or Ph.D. program.&#x20;
