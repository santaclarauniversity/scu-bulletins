Mechanical Engineering applies the fields of physics, mathematics, and materials science to the design and realization of mechanical and thermal systems. For over a century mechanical engineers have played a central role in creating the infrastructure of modern society, while addressing the emerging interdisciplinary challenges of tomorrow. The undergraduate curriculum provides a rigorous theoretical foundation coupled with hands-on laboratories and projects. Mechanical engineering students have the opportunity to make real connections with faculty and work with them on cutting-edge research. Rooted in the Jesuit tradition, our curriculum challenges students to consider the moral, ethical, and social impacts of engineering, while supporting entrepreneurial thinking. Combined with the breadth of the core curriculum, the mechanical engineering program trains the whole person to create engineers of conscience, competence, and compassion.

The undergraduate Mechanical Engineering Program will educate students who:

-   Become successful professionals, demonstrating their knowledge and depth of understanding of mechanical engineering in industry, or further academic studies.

-   Develop ethical and innovative engineering solutions that meet our responsibilities to society and the environment, based on fundamental principles using modern analysis techniques, testing, and validation, and guided by the concepts of competence, conscience, and compassion.

-   Work in a team environment, communicate effectively, share their knowledge and expertise, and exercise leadership as appropriate.

-   Are dedicated to lifelong learning and personal growth for the betterment of society and to meet the challenges and obligations of tomorrow.
