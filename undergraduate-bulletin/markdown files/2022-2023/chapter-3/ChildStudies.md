The Child Studies (CHST) major is designed for undergraduates interested in careers working with children and families in school or community settings. The curriculum encompasses a social-justice, anti-racist, and cultural competence perspective, all constructs that are critical for 21st century child advocates. As a complement to the curriculum, CHST majors work extensively with children and families in local schools and community-based programs. Our faculty is committed to addressing the myriad issues affecting marginalized populations: education policy, the pre-school to prison pipeline, socio-emotional processes, political dynamics, community organizing, institutional change, and so much more. CHST majors earn a Bachelor of Science degree and are prepared to matriculate to graduate studies in fields, such as teacher education, social work, counseling, psychology, law and more. CHST advisors can provide information about teaching credential programs and many other vocations requiring further graduate or professional school education. Our CHST alumni pursue careers in social work, teaching, counseling, family law, speech and language pathology, occupational therapy, or nonprofit agencies that provide community services to children and families.

Lower-Division Courses
----------------------

### 3. Child Studies

Designed to cultivate critical awareness, thinking, and action with respect to children and families in schools and broader communities.

(4 units)

### 4. Cultural Competence and Humility with Children and Families 

Cultural competence and humility taken together allow us to better communicate, listen, teach, learn, support, and lead in multiple contexts. Becoming culturally competent requires the critical development of awareness, attitudes, knowledge, and skills that create supportive and transformative interactions when working with children and families within diverse environments. This course is designed to cultivate knowledge of self and others while also promoting a formative anti-oppression framework. Through readings, films, discussion, and trainings, we will devote ourselves to the rigorous examination of personal, interpersonal, and systemic/structural racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism, ageism, ableism, and religious discrimination toward the pursuit of social justice with children and families. (4 units)

### 5. Compassionate Leadership and Mindfulness

Explores current research on how mindfulness (cultivating self-awareness) within our personal and professional lives leads to essential workplace leadership competencies such as: leading courageous conversations, managing conflict and emotions, and developing resilience in challenging situations.

This course requires participation in community-based learning experiences. (4 units)

### 11. Quantitative Research Methods and Statistics in Child Studies

An introduction to research methods and exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, probability, sampling, estimation, and statistical inference. Work problems are focused on how statistics are used in evaluating and understanding questions about children in school and community settings. PSYC 51 fulfills the CHST 11 requirement for psychology double majors. (4 units)

### 12. Qualitative Research Methods in Child Studies

### 66. Movement Education

An exploration of movement as a primary site of learning and meaning-making for children and youth.

Course culminates in student-led collaboratively designed lessons taught to children from neighboring K--8 schools. (4 units)

### 75. Technology and Education

Explores the relationship between technology, society, and education. Students investigate the appropriate role of technology in educational reform, evaluate the personal impact of social media on children and adolescents, and propose solutions to the pressing educational needs of our society. Interactive and engaging discussions and team projects highlight the dynamic quality of these issues. (4 units)
