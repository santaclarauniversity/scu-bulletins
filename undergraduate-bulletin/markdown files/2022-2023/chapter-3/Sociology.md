### 195. Silicon Valley Seminar

Seniors, who have successfully completed SOCI 118, 119, 120 121 or 122,.

In the early 20^th^ century, Chicago School sociologists approached the city as a collection of distinct but interdependent neighborhoods, or an "urban mosaic." They sought to understand the origins and dynamics of connected neighborhoods, and the forces that determined their fate and bound them together. Borrowing from this logic and the blurring of place that has occurred in expansion, this course approaches Silicon Valley as a constellation of interacting neighborhoods, experiences, and populations. The course traces recent history and populations to provide students with an understanding of the forces (political, economic, social, and cultural) that produce and sustain Silicon Valley; how different populations experience and interpret the region; and an understanding of Silicon's Valley past and present challenges (e.g., homelessness, gentrification, ethnic and racial resorting, mobility, and gangs). This course combines classroom instruction with community engagement to provide experiential learning opportunities in local neighborhoods and their institutions.

Students practice being "public sociologists" by enlisting knowledge and research to encourage individual, societal, and political decisions that are ethical and justice-oriented. A background in philosophical ethics helps public sociologists consider their own moral development as well as the salient issues at stake when considering potential solutions to controversial social problems. Thus, being a public sociologist means taking a stand on complex ethical issues by having a foundation in both philosophical and sociological moral methodology. (5 units)

### 128. Religion, Science, and Technology

Students will explore the ways that these stories and images have been represented in various forms of media (particularly film and television), and learn to connect these representations to the politics of carceral expansion prevalent at the time. Throughout this course we will discuss how storytelling, evolving technology, and cultural/artistic movements have been essential for convincing the public to see criminal threats as real and restrictive social control as necessary; at the same time, these have also been key for artists and organizers seeking to challenge the logic of law-and-order politics, reflect the experiences of those most impacted by these politics, or defend their communities from carceral state violence.
