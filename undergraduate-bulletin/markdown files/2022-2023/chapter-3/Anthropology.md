The Department of Anthropology offers a degree program leading to a bachelor of science in anthropology. A solid undergraduate foundation in anthropology secures the analytical skills needed to undertake professional degrees in anthropology, business, law, public health, social services, or provides a foundation for embarking on a number of other professional careers. The department also offers a minor, several emphases, and an honors thesis option.

### Emphasis Programs in Anthropology

Anthropology majors have the option of completing a special emphasis program to complement their majors. The emphasis is not a narrow specialization but reflects competence in the subfields of the discipline. Completion of a special emphasis program will be noted on student transcripts with the approval of the department chair.

The emphasis in applied anthropology prepares students to use anthropological knowledge to address critical human issues in careers outside academia. Through coursework and related internships, students will gain a better understanding of how anthropological knowledge and skills can be used in occupations related to health and medicine, international development, environment, government, business, education, immigration, and poverty. The emphasis in archaeology focuses on a deeper understanding of the human past and how it is studied. This is a possible course of study for majors with an interest in employment in cultural resource management or graduate study in archaeology. The biological emphasis provides in-depth training in the field of biological anthropology. Students will acquire intellectual breadth and depth with regard to the interdisciplinary nature of anthropology and the biological and cultural interactions that have influenced human evolution and modern human diversity.

Requirements for the Minor
--------------------------

Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in anthropology:

-   ANTH 1 or 2

-   ANTH 3

-   One additional lower-division anthropology course

-   ANTH 110

-   Two approved upper-division anthropology courses

-   Four anthropology seminars

Lower-Division Courses
----------------------

### 1. Introduction to Biological Anthropology

Using an evolutionary framework, we examine how past and current human variation is measured, our place in nature, human genetics, human and nonhuman primate biology and behavior, the primate and hominin fossil record, and the origin and meaning of human biological and behavioral variation. Students gain experience in biological anthropology methods, data analysis and interpretation, and the theoretical frameworks that guide our understanding of what it means to be human. Laboratory 15 hours. (4 units)

### 2. Introduction to Archaeology

How do archaeologists understand the past? This course examines the methods, theories, and analytical techniques that archaeologists use to study the past and interpret ancient cultures. Selective survey of human cultures over time in different regions of the world. Laboratory 15 hours. (4 units)

### 3. Introduction Cultural Anthropology

This course provides an introduction to the subject matter, research methods, and applications of cultural anthropology. Its purpose is to help students understand how different human groups think and live, how they cope with life's demands and expectations, and how they make sense of the world. In order to gain additional experience with diverse cultural groups, students are required to participate in off-campus Arrupe partnerships. (4 units)

### 4. Vanished Peoples and Lost Civilizations

"Popular archaeology" is addressed by examining past societies, human migrations and cultural contacts, and ancient human behavior and technologies. Ideas and assumptions found in movies and other popular media will be evaluated in light of current archaeological data and theory. (4 units)

### 5. Popular Culture and Bioanthropology

From *King Kong* to *Clan of the Cave Bear*, students examine popular culture interpretations of biological anthropology. After reviewing the history of biological anthropology, we analyze popular avenues (film, cartoons, newspapers, fiction) through which the public has been informed about human variation, the human fossil record, primate behavior, and human genetics. (4 units)

### 6. Screen Time: Culture, Film, and Media in the 21st Century

This course uses anthropological perspectives and methods to explore how popular media shapes, creates, and transforms our understanding of culture, identity, and social relationships in the 21st century. This course is not just about culture, difference, and identity, but also about how we learn about and intersect with cultural and identity formation processes through various forms of media. Throughout the course we will use feature-length films as starting points for thinking critically about culture, gender, class, race/racism, economics, ideology, family, kinship, and violence. We will also be critically discussing how film and media shape our perceptions and understandings of the complex, global, and highly socially mediated world in which we live. One of the core premises of this course, following Bird and Godwin (2006), is that we cannot simply assume that media "speaks for itself." Building upon the work of cultural and media anthropologists, and the late Neil Postman, the primary goal of this course is to push students to take a more active, and anthropologically informed, approach to the highly mediated world in which we live. (4 units)

### 7. Field Course in Archaeological Methods

On-site archaeological field research with practical experience in the basic techniques of excavation and data analysis. Students will gain experience in mapping, stratigraphic excavation, and field processing of finds. Laboratory component will include community outreach, cataloging, and relevant special analyses.

We will also examine how individuals navigate the challenges of living in poverty, sometimes exerting their own agency despite having minimal access to resources. Over the course of the quarter, we will turn a critical eye towards discussions of the "poverty problem" or "culture of poverty". We will develop a more nuanced understanding of the conditions that create and reinforce these inequities, and how they give rise to biological feedback mechanisms that influence individual health outcomes. (5 units)

### 140. Food, Culture, and the Environment

Exploration of the history and impact that food choices have made on human societies and the environment.
