Classics is the study of all aspects of the life and culture of ancient Greece and Rome in their Mediterranean context and their enduring relevance to our lives. The Department of Classics offers all levels of ancient Greek and Latin as well as courses that explore the origins of Western literature, history, art, mythology, philosophy, religion, ethics, government, science, architecture, engineering, city planning, and so forth. Most courses in the department require no knowledge of an ancient language and are open to any interested student. Latin or Greek may be taken to satisfy the second language requirement. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the field, classics provides an ideal liberal arts curriculum that is an excellent background for careers in many areas.

Students majoring or minoring in classics may pursue one of three different tracks: classical languages and literatures, classical studies, or ancient studies. Students who want to major and minor in classics must do so in different tracks.

Satisfies the Civic Engagement requirement. (5 units)

### 183. Hercules!

While many people today may first encounter Hercules through the popular Disney movie, TV shows, or comic books, the original character of Hercules in the ancient world is much more complex than many of these current depictions convey.

### 188. Greek Justice: Ancient Roots of the Modern Jury

This course explores the ancient Greek roots of modern American justice. We study how the classical Athenian court system worked, as well as how the Greeks used poetry, tragedy, comedy, mythology, and philosophy to develop and discuss the concepts of justice that underpinned their court systems. We focus particularly on the nature of justice, the rationale for jury trials, and the role law plays in a democratic state, comparing and contrasting classical Greek and modern American ideas. At the end of the course students run trials using classical Athenian court structure and judicial philosophy to try controversial cases currently working their way through the U.S. federal court system.
