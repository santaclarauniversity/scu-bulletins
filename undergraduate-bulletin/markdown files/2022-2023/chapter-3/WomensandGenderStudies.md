The Department of Women's and Gender Studies brings together scholars and scholarship on women and gender, areas that have come to occupy an increasingly important place in a number of disciplines in the last quarter century. Areas of inquiry include the participation of women in social and cultural production; the construction of gender and its role as a constitutive element of social, political, economic, and legal structures; feminist theory; and the development of ideas about femininities, masculinities, and sexualities. Gender is examined as it intersects with class, sexuality, ethnicity, disability, age, nationality, and the like. The Department of Women's and Gender Studies provides an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to understanding the social and cultural constructions of gender that shape the experiences of everyone. The curriculum offers a solid foundation in women's and gender studies, facilitating graduate study and careers involving gender justice concerns, and preparing students for leadership roles in diverse workplaces and communities.

### 116. Visions of Abolition 

Abolition has a deep and rich history that originates in slavery abolition and connects to contemporary demands to abolish the prison industrial complex, policing, and ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement). But calls for abolition are as much about envisioning new worlds as they are about ending various oppressive and unjust institutions. "Abolition," as Ruth Wilson Gilmore puts it, "is about presence, not absence." In this course, we will survey different visions of abolition, paying particular attention to clarifying and evaluating the moral arguments made by abolitionists. What does it mean, exactly, to call for the abolition of an institution rather than for reforms? What are the justifications for and critiques of these radical re-imaginings of our socio-political structures? We will also investigate the intersection of abolitionist issues with race, nationality, class, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, among other dimensions of identity. Finally, we will examine ethical theories of abolition democracy and transformative justice: two notions that abolitionists employ when thinking through how to build life-affirming institutions and community-based accountability processes in place of carceral systems.

This seminar addresses systems of structural racism as they condition possibilities and threats to the health and well-being of publics in the United States.

These patterns of racial discrimination work alongside gendered systems of heteronormativity to reinforce white supremacy and the inequitable distribution of social and economic resources, influencing multiple pathways to health and well-being. Through in-depth, discussion-based engagement with case studies of structural racism in interconnected systems of education, health, criminal justice, the law, policing, housing and employment, the seminar considers the critical role of anti-Black racism and white supremacy in entrenching racial inequality and harm at the systems level. Students will design projects to apply scholarship to critical anti-racist praxis. Also listed as PHSC 187. Enrollment by permission of instructor ( 5 units)

### 132. Sociology of Gender

Gender is a central organizing principle in social relations giving rise to institutional and social practices that distinguish between men and women on the basis of apparent difference and inequality. This course develops the sociological analysis of gender systems in contemporary American society. In this course, we will critically examine the multiple ways that gender structures the social world in which we live, and the way that race and sexuality interact with gender. We will highlight social practices at multiple levels of analysis, including biological and socialization processes at the individual level. Next, we will explore how gender shapes the interactions between and among women and men, creating and recreating gender. We will then use this multilevel framework to examine the workings of gender in the American workplace and as individuals balance work and family obligations. Finally, we will conclude by considering the possibilities of a degendered or less-gendered society. The central goal throughout the course is to understand how gender roles and attitudes shape social structure, and how gender inequalities are maintained in everyday social situations.
