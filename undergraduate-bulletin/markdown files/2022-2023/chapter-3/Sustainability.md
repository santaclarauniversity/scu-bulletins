Sustainability

*Director:* Leslie Gray

The sustainability minor helps students discover the connections and balance among a healthy environment, just societies, and a vibrant economy that meet all people's fundamental needs currently and in the future, especially those of the global poor. Courses explore the environmental, societal, and economic aspects of sustainability, and how to take action to improve sustainability.
