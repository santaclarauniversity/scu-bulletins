The Department of Philosophy offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. Philosophy inquires directly into the relation of human beings to the world: what we are, how we know, what values are, how we live. Worth pursuing for its own sake, philosophical inquiry also promotes analytical thinking and precise expression and, thus, is excellent undergraduate preparation for a number of professional careers in areas such as law, government, finance, media, writing, and computer programming. To qualify for honors in philosophy, the major ordinarily must have a 3.5 grade point average in philosophy courses and complete PHIL 197 with a grade of Aâˆ’, or better.

### 146. Philosophy As A Way Of Life

This course has an audacious aim to help students live a better life. For philosophers such as Socrates and Confucius, philosophy was concerned with living well. But what does that mean for today? We will attempt to answer that question by examining western and non-western philosophical traditions in order to glean insights into a life that pursues goals such as attaining wisdom, tranquility, harmony, and the like. Whereas many philosophy courses today focus solely on arguments and objections, this class emphasizes other methods such as narrative/story-telling, close observation of exemplars, imitative activities, contemplative or meditative exercises, and immersing oneself in a specific way of living such as Confucianism, Buddhism, Stoicism, Benedictine monasticism, among others.
