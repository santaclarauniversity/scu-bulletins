The Department of Physics offers major programs of lecture and laboratory instruction leading to the bachelor of science in physics, the bachelor of science in physics with a biophysics emphasis, and the bachelor of science in engineering physics. The department also provides an academic minor in physics and required and elective courses for students majoring in other fields.

Common career goals of physics majors include professional employment in industry, in a government lab, or at a university. It is not uncommon for physics majors to become entrepreneurs, work in the business or finance sector, or teach at the secondary school level. The undergraduate major program in physics is appropriate preparation for graduate study in physics, astronomy and astrophysics, biophysics, environmental science, geological science and geophysics, medical physics and medicine, patent law, oceanography, and other fields.

Popular second majors, or minors for physics majors, include mathematics, computer science, chemistry or areas of engineering .The SCU physics major is offered in two forms. Students can choose between a traditional "physics track" or a "biophysics track". Both tracks provide a solid preparation for graduate studies and for nearly all of the postgraduate opportunities open to traditional physics majors. Students who complete the biophysics track will have additional opportunities in medicine, the life sciences, and related industries.

The engineering physics major is particularly appropriate for the applied science student who intends to do research and development work in industry, or attend graduate school in physics, applied physics, materials science or various engineering disciplines. The engineering physics major covers a broad spectrum of courses in mathematics, engineering, and physics. This program emphasizes, to a greater extent than the traditional engineering major, the physics fundamentals that are applicable to new technologies as well as to the more established ones.

Research in the department is currently funded by the Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, NASA and private industry. Majors in physics and engineering physics often participate in faculty research projects through PHYS 198 (Undergraduate Physics Research) or external grants, internships or fellowships, including Geoff and Josie Fox Summer Research Fellowships. Students also have opportunities for part-time employment assisting faculty in laboratory and related teaching activities.

A student whose GPA is below a 2.5 must obtain approval from the department chair to declare a Physics or Engineering Physics major.
