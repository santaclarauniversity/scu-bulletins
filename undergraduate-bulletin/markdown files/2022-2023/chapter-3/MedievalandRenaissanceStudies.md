Medieval and Renaissance Studies
================================

*Director:* Jacquelyn Hendricks

The minor in Medieval and Renaissance studies offers students from all departments a cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary program of study in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. These periods lay on the edge of modernity, when the distinctive characteristics of the contemporary world began to form and when major new connections were made between Europe and Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, and the Americas. Study of these periods from many different points of view affords an opportunity to gain valuable perspectives on the ways that Medieval and Renaissance people, events, and institutions helped to shape the modern world. Completion of the minor is noted on the student's transcript, and students receive a certificate acknowledging their accomplishment.

Requirements for the Minor
--------------------------

Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in Medieval and Renaissance studies:

-   Seven courses selected from three different departments with a maximum of three lower-division courses.

-   One of the upper-division courses must require an interdisciplinary research paper based on source materials and secondary works dealing with a topic rooted in the Medieval and/or Renaissance periods. The research paper requirement may be fulfilled by enrolling in a199 in one of the associated departments under the supervision of an affiliated faculty member and the program director.

-   The study of French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin, and/or Spanish is strongly recommended but not required. Students should consult with the program director to determine the cluster of courses best suited to their personal interests and preparation.
