Asian Studies
=============

*Director:* Gregory P. Corning

The Asian Studies minor is designed to provide an introduction to the cultures and languages of Asia. Courses in several disciplines enable students to sample different dimensions of Asian cultures as well as focus on a specific area of interest. Students are strongly urged to spend a summer or quarter in one of the University-approved study abroad programs in Asia. Please note that courses about the Asian American experience are considered ethnic studies courses and do not count for the Asian Studies minor.

Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in Asian studies:

**Culture Courses**

-   Two lower-division courses and four upper-division courses (maximum of two upper-division courses from a student's major and three in any one department) selected from the list of approved courses
