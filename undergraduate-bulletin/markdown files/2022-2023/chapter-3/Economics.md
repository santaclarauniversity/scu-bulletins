As one of the social sciences, economics studies how the choices we make as individuals---as consumers and producers, as savers and investors, as managers and employees, as citizens and voters---combine to determine how society uses its scarce resources to produce and distribute goods and services. This practical discipline provides insights into important issues such as, the determinants of wealth and poverty---unemployment, inflation, international trade, and economic growth; as well as success and failure in the marketplace. The rigorous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Economics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting. Students considering graduate study in economics leading to a master's or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appropriate course of study.

### Concentration in Data Analysis for Economics

The concentration in Data Analysis for Economics provides a structured course of study for economics majors to develop their skills in econometrics and data analysis and apply them to issues in economics and related areas. In addition to completing all requirements for the major in economics, students must pass the following courses with a grade of "C" or higher\*:

\*All upper-division courses in the concentration can count as upper-division electives toward the economics major. One

(and only one) of the courses in list C may be substituted with: (a) an approved course in another social science or business discipline with a significant data analysis component; or (b) an independent study course with a substantial data analysis component (4 or 5 units). Substitutions must be approved by the Concentration advisor. Currently pre-approved substitutions: CSCI 183, ENVS 117, OMIS 114, or OMIS 150. Non-economics courses will not count as one of the upper-division electives toward the economics major.
