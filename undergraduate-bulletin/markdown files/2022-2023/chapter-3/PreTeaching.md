Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing to offer professional preparation for prospective elementary school, middle school, and high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades. Each credential program includes content for teaching English learners that authorizes the credential holder to provide instruction for English language development and specially designed academic instruction in English within the subject area and grade level authorization. Bilingual authorization in Spanish is also available. The teaching credential program at SCU is combined with a Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Students interested in TK--12 teaching should consider completing an interdisciplinary minor in urban education offered through the College of Arts and Sciences.

The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area, who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to undergraduate studies and the credential/MAT program. The FTP is managed through the Child Studies Program in the College of Arts and Sciences.

**Preparation for Multiple-Subject Credential**

Students interested in a career in elementary or middle school teaching generally earn a bachelor's degree before entering into a post-graduate teacher credential program. Students who would like to teach TK--8 (self-contained classroom) in California are strongly encouraged to select from majors such as psychology, child studies, or sociology within the College of Arts and Sciences, though any undergraduate major is acceptable. The undergraduate program of study, including the Core Curriculum, should encompass the range of subjects taught in grade school and include courses that have field-based learning placements in settings that directly serve school-aged children. The SCU undergraduate Core Curriculum provides a broad education in English, mathematics, science, social science, the arts, and humanities, all of which will be valuable preparation to become an elementary school teacher. Students are recommended to pursue the interdisciplinary minor in urban education to participate in undergraduate pre-teaching coursework. Those requirements can be found in the Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study section in this chapter. Students must demonstrate the subject matter competency component for the multiple-subject credential by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET) for Multiple Subjects. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills (see below for additional information on this requirement).

**Preparation for Single-Subject Credential**

Students interested in a career in secondary school teaching in a particular subject matter area are advised to fulfill the requirements of the academic major of their intended teaching specialization. California teaching credentials are available in the following subject areas: agriculture, art, biological sciences, business, chemistry, English, geosciences, health science, home economics, industrial and technology education, mathematics, music, physical education, physics, general sciences, social science, and world languages other than English. Students who earn a degree in a single subject credential area (e.g. English, Biology, Mathematics) are now waived from the CSET (subject matter exam) requirement. An undergraduate interdisciplinary minor in urban education is also recommended. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills (see below for additional information on this requirement).

**Requirements for Multiple-Subject and Single-Subject Credentials**

The minimum requirements for the multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential include:

-   A bachelor's degree in a subject area from an accredited institution

-   Demonstrated knowledge of the United States Constitution by completion of undergraduate coursework on the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution such as POLI 1 or HIST 96A, -or passage of an approved examination

-   Demonstrated basic educational skills by completing one of the following: California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST); CSET: Multiple Subjects Plus Writing Skills Examination; CSU Early Assessment Program or the CSU Placement Examinations (English and Mathematics sections); Achieve Qualifying Score on the SAT or ACT; College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations (English and Calculus or Statistics); Basic Skills Examination from a state other than California. Some Santa Clara University coursework may also satisfy the basic skills requirement; consult with the Pre-Teaching Advisor.

-   Completion of an approved program of professional education, including field experience achieved through student teaching or internship

-   Completion of a state-approved subject matter preparation program, or passage of the CSET, a subject-area competency examination, in the area one plans to teach. Some single subject areas may be satisfied by SCU majors; consult with the Pre-Teaching Advisor.

-   For multiple-subject credential candidates only: Demonstrated knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading by passing the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA) examination

**School of Education and Counseling Psychology Teaching Credential Program**

The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential can be completed as part of the Masters of Arts in Teaching and Teaching Credential (MATTC) program. This program requires a fifth year of study following the bachelor's degree and qualifies the student for a preliminary teaching credential. The MATTC program includes graduate coursework in educational foundations, curriculum design, teaching methods, and supervised student teaching. Bilingual authorization in Spanish is also available. Students seeking additional information regarding the MATTC program with a multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential should contact the Advisor of PreTeaching or the Graduate Admissions Office in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology.
