Finance is at the center of well-managed businesses, from high technology companies to mutual fund companies. Development of knowledge and managerial skills in the corporate and investment settings are the major goals of the finance program. Graduates with a degree in finance pursue careers as corporate financial officers, traders, investment managers, financial analysts, financial planners, investment bankers, stockbrokers, regulators, and other specialties. Corporate finance officers manage the assets and value of corporations. They examine which new products and investments will be profitable, analyze the most cost-effective ways to produce them, and determine where to get the money needed to fund new ventures. Personal financial planners and stockbrokers help people make wise investments by selecting good stocks and assembling efficient portfolios. Students in finance also learn how to understand and analyze information from capital markets, engage in mergers and acquisitions, and undertake investments in new ventures, real estate, and international markets.
