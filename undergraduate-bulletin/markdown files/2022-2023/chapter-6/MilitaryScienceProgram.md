Military Science Program
========================

*Professor of Military Science:* (Director) Lieutenant Colonel Sean Chang

*Senior Military Instructor:* Master Sergeant Geoffrey Landon

The Military Science Program offers classes open to all Santa Clara students as well as Stanford University, San Jose State University, and University of California, Santa Cruz, students. The Military Science Program is designed to develop management skills and leadership abilities for successful careers in both the corporate world and the military. Students who complete the ROTC program are eligible for appointment and commissioning as officers in the United States Army.

The military science core curriculum consists of six lower-division classes in the ROTC Basic Course and seven upper-division courses in the ROTC Advanced Course. Cadets may take a summer course (MILS 24) in lieu of the six lower-division courses. The professional military education of ROTC cadets consists of two components: a baccalaureate degree from Santa Clara University (or one of the cross-enrolled universities) and at least one undergraduate course from each of five designated fields of study. Prior to commissioning, cadets must take at least one course in military history.

For those planning on commissioning into the U.S. Army, the curriculum is divided into ROTC Basic Course requirements and ROTC Advanced Course requirements. To proceed to the ROTC Advanced Course classes, students must complete either the six required ROTC Basic Course classes or attend a summer class at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The director of the Military Science Program must approve exceptions to this progression.

**ROTC Basic Course Requirements**

The ROTC Basic Course, Fundamentals of Leadership and Management, includes the first-year and second-year courses (MILS 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23) designed for beginning students who want to qualify for entry into the ROTC Advanced course and for those students who may want to try military science without obligations. A student can also qualify for entry in the ROTC Advanced Course by completing the summer training camp (MILS 24).

**ROTC Advanced Course Requirements**

The ROTC Advanced Course, Advanced Leadership and Management, consists of the third-year and fourth-year courses (MILS 131, 132, 133, 134, 141, 142, and 143) open to students who have completed or earned placement credit for the ROTC Basic Course.

Students must complete all courses numbered greater than MILS 130, to include MILS 134, a six-week Cadet Leader Course during the summer, in sequence, unless otherwise approved by the professor of military science. The ROTC Advanced Course qualifies students for commissions as officers in the U.S. Army. Students who do not desire to compete for a commission as an officer in the Army may take these courses for academic credit with approval by the professor of military science.

**Leadership Laboratories**

Leadership laboratories, held weekly for three hours, are required of all students. Performance during lab periods is reflected in the student's course grade. Labs include activities such as terrain navigation, first aid training, virtual battle simulations, drill and ceremonies, and tactical leader development exercises.

**Laboratory and Field Exercises**

During each quarter of class work, weekly lab work is required. Two off-campus exercises involving adventure training, leadership training, and survival skills are optional for non-scholarship ROTC Basic Course students. Two off-campus exercises focusing on leadership and military skills are mandatory for ROTC Advanced Course students and contracted students.
