Summer Sessions
===============

Director: Allyson Morris

The Summer Sessions Office coordinates a comprehensive schedule of undergraduate courses in most of the academic departments from June through September. Summer Sessions invites students to reach their educational goals through the convenience of accelerated courses.

Over 140 summer courses are held on campus and online. Sessions are three, five, and 10 weeks in length. Eight (8) units constitutes full-time status for undergraduate students enrolled in summer courses. Content, prerequisites, and units of summer courses are equivalent to fall, winter, and spring courses.

**Academic Regulations**

Most of the academic regulations that apply in the fall, winter, and spring quarters also apply to the summer terms. Courses taken during summer sessions are included in the records of matriculated Santa Clara University students for the determination of GPA, class level, honors, probation, and disqualification. Any student who is not permitted to register during fall, winter, or spring quarters (e.g. disqualified, suspension) may not enroll for summer courses at SCU.

**Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment**

The Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment policy is not in effect during the summer as it is during the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Students who are officially enrolled in a class and fail to attend the first and any subsequent class meetings will remain enrolled in the class and be responsible for paying all tuition and fees associated with the class. Students are responsible for dropping a course if they are unable to attend due to changes in the class schedule or personal obligations. Non-attendance does NOT relieve a student of the obligation to pay tuition and fees. In addition to paying full tuition and fees, an academic hold will be placed on the student's account to prevent any further registration transactions. Students who do not formally drop a class for which they are officially enrolled will receive an "F" grade for the course(s), and be liable for all tuition and fees incurred during the summer. Students must formally drop a course via eCampus or by submitting a Drop Form to the Enrollment Services Center prior to the published deadlines.

**Auditing Courses**

Interested students should review the Auditing Courses section in Chapter 8 of the Undergraduate Bulletin for information.

**Course Load Limits Policy/Overload Policy**

There are NO EXCEPTIONS to the course load policy for summer sessions. Students who register for more than the maximum course load will be administratively withdrawn from the course that creates the overload. Students who add overload units in violation of this policy may not receive credit for the course that causes the policy violation.

The intensive pace of Sessions 1, 2, and 3 require the following restrictions on summer course loads:

Session 1

-   Students may not enroll in more than 10 units during this session

Session 2

-   Students may not enroll in more than 10 units during this session

Session 3 (A, B, and C):

-   Students may not enroll in or attend more than one Session 3 lab science (chemistry or physics) course at a time

-   If enrolled in or attending a Session 3 lab science course, students may not be simultaneously enrolled in or attending any Session 1, 2, or 4 course

**Course Cancellations**

Santa Clara University reserves the right to make changes in the schedules or policies without prior notice or obligation. If a course is canceled, the Summer Sessions Office will immediately send a notification to enrolled students at their \@scu.edu address. Students should check their SCU email daily.

**Enrollment and Course Restriction Policy**

Students may not sit in classes without formally enrolling. Credit is not given to students who attend class without formally enrolling and paying tuition. Students must be officially registered in classes based on the procedures outlined on the Summer Sessions website and must have paid all tuition and fees by the published deadlines. The instructor's signature on an add form after the add period does not constitute a formal enrollment without tuition payment. Initial registration or class additions will not be accepted beyond the late registration/add period as set forth in the Summer Sessions calendar.

Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to administrative withdrawal from that course. This includes:

-   Students who have not satisfied course prerequisites

-   Students who have not obtained the instructor's permission as specified in certain courses

**Independent Study**

Eligible Santa Clara University students may pursue independent study with the approval of a faculty member. Interested students should review the Independent Study section in Chapter 8 of the Undergraduate Bulletin for additional information.

**Internships**

Interested current Santa Clara University students should inquire with individual departments and programs for information about summer internships.

**New Fall Transfer Students**

Transfer students who have been accepted at Santa Clara University for the fall quarter should contact the Senior Record and Transcript Analyst in the Office of the Registrar before registering for summer classes.

**Incoming First-Year Students**

Incoming first-year students may be eligible to enroll in summer sessions. For additional information, please contact the Summer Sessions Office at scusummer\@scu.edu.
