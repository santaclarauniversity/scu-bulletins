Undergraduate Degrees
=====================

The School of Engineering confers the degree of bachelor of science with majors in bioengineering, civil engineering, computer science and engineering, web design and engineering, electrical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, general engineering, and mechanical engineering. The specialized bachelor of science programs in civil engineering, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, [http://www.abet.org](http://www.abet.org), and the bachelor of science program in computer science and engineering is also accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, [http://www.abet.org](http://www.abet.org) . The bachelor of science programs in bioengineering, electrical and computer engineering, general engineering, and web design and engineering are not yet accredited by ABET. The engineering school offers minors in engineering, computer science and engineering, construction management, electrical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, aerospace engineering, and mechanical engineering as well as two interdisciplinary minors, one in bioengineering and one in technical innovation, design thinking, and the entrepreneurial mindset. All of the undergraduate engineering programs require students to complete extensive course sequences in mathematics and natural science as well as engineering.

Success in completing these critical course sequences is highly dependent upon having the necessary technical background at each stage. Accordingly, prerequisites for all engineering courses are strictly enforced.

Requirements for the Bachelor of Science
----------------------------------------

To qualify for the degree of bachelor of science in the School of Engineering, students must complete the minimum number of units specified for the particular major and satisfy the requirements of the undergraduate Core Curriculum and the major. It is possible that one course can satisfy more than one of the core requirements for engineering students.
