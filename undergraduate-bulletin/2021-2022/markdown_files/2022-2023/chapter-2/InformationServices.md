Technology Support
------------------

### Computing Services

Undergraduate students are supported with a variety of computing services. Students will receive an SCU Username that provides access to multiple digital services via [MySCU](https://www.scu.edu/login). Students also have access to ubiquitous high-speed wired and wireless networks for campus resources as well as connection to the internet via the University's 10 GB connections. Students may use the network to access their Gmail and GSuite account, Camino learning management system, SmartPrint, Zoom web conferencing, Portfolium, Qualtrics, endpoint protection/antivirus software, and for wireless access.

SCU email is used by the University as one of the communication channels to send official notifications to undergraduate students, and is also used as a frequent communication tool between and among faculty and students. Students are therefore urged to use their SCU email address as their primary email. Students who opt to utilize other email services are advised to check their SCU email periodically to avoid missing important communications.

The University provides over 150 PC and Mac workstations in the Learning Commons with a variety of software packages to support both general computing needs and multimedia production.

Free guest wireless access is also available for students' visiting friends and family.

### eCampus

Students have access to administrative information and services at all times through [eCampus](https://ecampus.scu.edu/). eCampus services include the ability to enroll in classes, review financial accounts, maintain personal information like addresses and phone numbers, request housing, buy parking permits, and more. Student employees can also use eCampus to view their paycheck, fill out their timesheet, and more.

### Information Security

The Information Security Office protects the University's information assets and ensures that students have access to all of the information resources they need. This office provides advice to students on how to best protect themselves, as well as ensuring that the University is protected with modern defense capabilities against malware, virus outbreaks, and other attacks.
