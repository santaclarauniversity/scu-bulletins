Registration Policies and Regulations
=====================================

Enrollment and Registration for Classes
---------------------------------------

Students must be officially registered for all classes in accordance with the regulations, procedures, and dates in the quarterly undergraduate [Deadlines & Registration](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/registrar/FALL2020VBFINAL.pdf) booklet. Registration is subject to full payment of tuition, room and board charges, and other fees associated with enrollment. The University reserves the right to deny registration to any student for reasonable cause. A student's eligibility to register for classes is subject to the clearance of any holds on the student's record for academic, financial, student conduct, or other reasons. Santa Clara students may not be concurrently enrolled at another college or university except for extraordinary reasons with the approval of the Dean of Academic Support Services, located in the Drahmann Center.

Students register for classes via University eCampus during the time assigned by the Office of the Registrar. Students who do not complete registration during the initial registration period may do so during the published late registration period for the term. Initial registration for a term or class additions are not accepted after the last day of the late registration period.

During the first week of each fall, winter, and spring term, students may add and drop classes in accordance with the procedures established by the Office of the Registrar. During the first, second, third, and fourth weeks of the term, a student may drop a class without receiving a mark of "W" for the class on their academic record. From the fifth week to the end of the seventh week of the term, a student may drop a class and receive a mark of "W" for the class on their academic record. Students may not drop classes after the last day of the seventh week of the term. Students who do not complete a course and do not drop the class in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in the class.

Students who have not earned 44 units, including transfer and test credit, may be subject to administrative withdrawal from upper-division courses. This restriction does not apply to upper-division courses for which a student has demonstrated sufficient proficiency.

Students may not sit in a class without formally enrolling in the class. Sitting in a class or obtaining an instructor's signature on an add form does not constitute enrollment.

Students who do not attend the first day of a class are subject to administrative cancellation of their enrollment in that class in order to make space available to other students. A student who must miss the first day of a class and wishes to remain in the course should contact the instructor in advance. No student who misses the first day of a class should assume that they have been dropped from the course. Students are responsible for checking the status of their enrollment in all courses prior to the end of the late registration period.

Unit Overload
-------------

Students may enroll for no more than 19 units unless they are in the University Honors Programor School of Engineering, their cumulative grade point average at Santa Clara is at least 3.3, or they have upper-division status and obtain approval from the Drahmann Center. One 2-unit course or two 1-unit courses are not counted as overload units. Students who meet the criteria above will not be permitted to register for more than 25 units without approval of the Dean of Academic Support Services. Students may register for courses that result in overload units only during the late registration period. See the website of the Office of the Registrar for registration schedules.

Auditing Courses
----------------

Students admitted to degree status at Santa Clara may audit one course in addition to their regular course load in a term. A maximum of three courses may be audited during a student's academic career. Permission to audit a course will be given only at the end of the late registration period and only if space is available in the class. No credit is assigned for an audited course, but the successful completion of an audit will be indicated on a student's transcript by the notation "AUD."

Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment
------------------------------------------------

Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to administrative cancellation of their enrollment in that course. Prior to the end of the late registration period, an instructor may notify the University Registrar to drop first-year students who registered in upper-division courses, to drop students who have not satisfied the prerequisites for the course, or to drop students lacking the instructor permission required for certain courses.

Withdrawal from the University
------------------------------

Students who wish to withdraw from the University must do so by the last day of classes, and must complete a withdrawal survey, appropriate forms, and an exit interview in the Drahmann Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's registration will be canceled without further academic penalty. Students who leave the University during a quarter without withdrawing in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in all courses in which they were registered and are not eligible for a refund of tuition or other fees.

Students who withdraw from the University are responsible for any outstanding financial obligations with the University. Students who used deferred payment plans or student loans during their attendance at the University must clear their financial obligations with the Financial Aid Office and the Bursar's Office. Students who have unpaid bills or other unsettled financial obligations with the University will not be eligible for re-enrollment until they have cleared all such obligations.

Withdrawal for Health Reasons
-----------------------------

Students may experience an illness, injury, or psychological condition that significantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely in their role as students. In these instances, the Policy for Withdrawal for Health Reasons allows time away from the University for treatment and recovery until functioning is restored to a level that will enable the student to return to the University. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the procedures for student withdrawals from the University for reasons of health and/or safety. The University has designated four categories relating to withdrawal. They differ according to who initiates the action, whether it is voluntary or not, and the re-enrollment procedures.

The Vice Provost for Student Life or designee, in consultation with the appropriate mental and medical health professionals and other staff as deemed necessary, is responsible for the implementation of this policy as stated in the Student Handbook.

Re-enrollment at the University
-------------------------------

A student who withdrew from the University is eligible to re-enroll without special permission under the following conditions:

-   The student left the University in good academic standing

-   The student has no outstanding financial obligations with the University

-   The student plans to return to the same college or school at the University

-   The student is returning within five years of the date of their withdrawal

Students who do not meet the conditions above must seek permission to re-enroll from the Dean of Academic Support Services. Re-enrolling students are subject to degree and curriculum requirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entry.

Students wishing to re-enroll must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing of their intent to return using the Returning Student form and should consult with a University advisor in the Drahmann Center to review their academic plans. Students on leave who have attended another college or university are permitted to transfer in only a maximum of 10 units of elective credit and are required to forward to the Office of the Registrar an official transcript of all work completed during their absence.
