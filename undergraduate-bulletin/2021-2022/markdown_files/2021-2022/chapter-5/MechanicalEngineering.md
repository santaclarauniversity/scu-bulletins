Mechanical engineering includes all aspects of design, development, control, and manufacture of mechanical systems and energy conversion systems. Mechanical engineering is essential to the proper design and manufacture of nearly every physical product in our modern world. As such, mechanical engineers are a fundamental resource for most industries, and they work in interdisciplinary environments. Mechanical engineers must have the ability to see both broad perspectives across disciplines and industries, and solve very local and specialized problems. The undergraduate curriculum addresses the education and training of mechanical engineering students and concentrates on two technical areas: (1) design and analysis of thermofluid systems for effective use of energy; and (2) design, analysis, and control of mechanical systems including the use of materials. The Mechanical Engineering educational program develops future engineers with a solid understanding of fundamentals and competence in analyzing engineering systems.

The undergraduate Mechanical Engineering Program will educate students that can:

-   Demonstrate their knowledge and depth of understanding of mechanical engineering in engineering practice and principles through professional success or attainment of advanced degrees.

-   Design and development components, systems, tests, or services that meet specifications in the context of economic, environmental, and societal requirements.

-   Develop engineering solutions based on fundamental principles using modern analysis techniques, testing, and validation.

-   Work in a team environment, share their knowledge and expertise, and exercise leadership as appropriate.

-   Communicate effectively with colleagues, customers, subordinates, and managers.

-   Act ethically and professionally in their careers.

-   Continue to learn and grow professionally.

Combined Bachelor of Science and Master of Science Program
----------------------------------------------------------

The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers a combined degree program leading to the bachelor of science and a master of science open to mechanical engineering majors. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bachelor's degree and can complete the requirements for a master of science in mechanical engineering at the end of the fifth year.

Undergraduate students admitted to the combined degree program may begin taking graduate classes during their senior year. They are required to enroll in the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the standard undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master of science degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 46 units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree and completion of thesis culminating experience. No course can be used to simultaneously satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree.

The Micro Scale Heat Transfer Laboratory (MSHTL) develops state-of-the-art and thermal transport in thin films experimentation in processes such as micro-boiling, spray cooling, and advanced electronic materials. Today, trends indicate that these processes are finding interesting applications on drop-on-demand delivery systems, inkjet technology and fast transient systems.

The Robotic Systems Laboratory is an interdisciplinary laboratory specializing in the design, control, and teleoperation of highly capable robotic systems for scientific discovery, technology validation, and engineering education. Laboratory students develop and operate systems that include spacecraft, underwater robots, aircraft, and land rovers. These projects serve as ideal testbeds for learning and conducting research in mechatronic system design, guidance and navigation, command and control systems, and human-machine interfaces.

**Undergraduate Laboratories**

The Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) and Prototyping Laboratory consists of two machine shops and a prototyping area. One machine shop is dedicated to student use for University-directed design and research projects. The second is a teaching lab used for undergraduate and graduate instruction. Both are equipped with modern machine tools such as lathes and milling machines. The milling machines all have two-axis computer numerically controlled (CNC) capability. The teaching lab also houses a three-axis CNC vertical machining center (VMC). Commercial CAM software is available to aid programming of the computer controlled equipment. The prototyping area is equipped with a rapid prototyping system that utilizes fused deposition modeling (FDM) to create plastic prototypes from CAD-generated models. Also featured in this area is a LaserCAMM CNC laser cutting system for nonmetallic materials.

The Fluid Dynamics Laboratory contains equipment to illustrate the principles of fluid flow and to familiarize students with hydraulic machines and their instrumentation. The lab also contains a subsonic wind tunnel equipped with a variable frequency axial flow fan to study aerodynamics.

The Instrumentation Laboratory contains seven computer stations equipped with state-of-the-art, PC-based data acquisition hardware and software systems. A variety of transducers and test experiments for making mechanical, thermal, and fluid measurements are part of this lab. Additionally, this lab contains equipment to describe three modes of heat transfer. The temperature measurement of the extended surface system allows students to learn steady state conduction, and the pyrometer enables measurement of emitted power by radiation. The training systems for heat exchanger and refrigeration system are also placed in the lab.

The Materials Laboratory contains equipment for metallography and optical examination of the microstructure of materials as well as instruments for mechanical properties characterization including tension, compression, hardness, and fatigue testing. The Materials Laboratory also has a tube furnace for heat treating at controlled heating rates.

The Vibrations and Control Systems Laboratory is equipped with two flexible test systems. One is capable of single- or multi-DOF modes, free or forced motion, and adjustable damping. The other is an inverted pendulum. Both systems can be controlled by a wide variety of control algorithms and are fully computer connected for data acquisition and control.
