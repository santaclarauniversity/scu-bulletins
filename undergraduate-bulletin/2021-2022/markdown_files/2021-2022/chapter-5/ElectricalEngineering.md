The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department offers major programs leading to the bachelor of science in electrical engineering or the bachelor of science in electrical and computer engineering, as well as required and elective courses for students majoring in other fields.

Electrical and computer engineering includes the broad range of design, construction, and operation of electrical components, circuits, and systems as well as the science and technology of design, construction, and implementation of the software and hardware components of modern computing systems and computer-controlled equipment. This includes sustainable energy and electric power, signal and image processing, embedded systems, control systems, nanotechnology and integrated circuits, antennas, RF and communication systems, and all phases of the transmission of information.

Laboratories are an important part of most undergraduate courses in the electrical and computer engineering program. Use of appropriate laboratory equipment, design tools, and components demonstrates fundamental concepts of the courses and acquaints students with methods and tools they may use after graduation. The department has five teaching laboratories that support courses in electric circuits, electronics, systems, logic design, and RF and communication. In addition, the program has a laboratory dedicated to senior design projects. All laboratories are supported by the facilities of the Engineering Computing Center.

Combined Bachelor of Science and Master of Science Program
----------------------------------------------------------

The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers a combined degree program leading to the bachelor of science in either major and a master of science in electrical and computer engineering. This program is open to majors with an approved grade point average in electrical and computer engineering, mathematics, and physics courses. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bachelor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science in electrical and computer engineering within a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree. Undergraduate students interested in the combined degree program are required to apply for the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year.

Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the full undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master's degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 46 units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. However, completion of 10 or more units of coursework in electrical and computer engineering taken for the master's degree satisfies the professional development requirement of the undergraduate program.

The program of studies for the master's degree may include up to 20 units of electrical and computer engineering upper-division elective coursework excluding ELEN 188 and 189. These undergraduate units can count toward a master's degree only if a grade of "B" or better is earned. Students who do not complete the combined degree program within six years of entering the University will automatically be transferred to the regular master's degree program. Although six years is the maximum timeframe for completing the combined degree, full-time students enrolling in February of their junior year normally complete both degrees within five years.
