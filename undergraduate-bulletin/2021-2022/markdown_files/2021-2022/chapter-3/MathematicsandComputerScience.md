The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science offers major programs leading to the bachelor of science in mathematics or the bachelor of science in computer science, as well as required and elective courses for students majoring in other fields. Either major may be pursued with any of three principal goals: preparation for graduate studies leading to advanced degrees in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, operations research, or other fields; preparation for secondary school teaching of mathematics or computer science; or preparation for a research career in business, industry, or government. The major in mathematics may be taken with an emphasis in applied mathematics, data science, financial mathematics, mathematical economics, or mathematics education. The emphasis in mathematics education is designed to prepare majors to take the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET). The major in computer science offers emphases specializing in algorithms and complexity, data science, security, software, or one of the student's choosing. Minors in mathematics or computer science are also available.

The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science maintains a program for the discovery, encouragement, and development of talent in mathematics or computer science among undergraduates. This program includes special sections, seminars, individual conferences, and directed study guided by selected faculty members. Students are also encouraged to participate actively in research projects directed by faculty.

Requirements for the Major
--------------------------

In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students majoring in mathematics or computer science must complete the following departmental requirements for the respective degree:

**Major in Mathematics**

-   CSCI 10 (or demonstrated equivalent proficiency in computer programming)

-   MATH 11, 12, 13, 14, 23, 51, 52, and 53

-   PHYS 31 and 32. Students with a special interest in the application of mathematics in the social sciences or economics may substitute ECON 170 or 173 for PHYS 32. Students planning to teach in secondary schools may substitute, with approval of the department chair, PHYS 11 and 12 for PHYS 31 and 32.

**Individual emphasis of the student's choosing**: In order to pursue this emphasis, a student must get their courses approved along with their advisor's signature at least three quarters before they graduate. Three of the five upper-division courses must be CSCI or MATH. The following are two examples:

-   **Computer Science and Art emphasis**:

    -   CSCI 168, COEN 165/ARTS 173, and one of ARTS 174 or ARTS 185

    -   Although COEN 178 is recommended, it does not count toward the five courses.

It is highly recommended that students (especially students in the Software emphasis) take additional upper-division courses beyond the minimum required for the degree, such as COEN 178.

For the major in either mathematics or computer science, at least four of the required upper-division courses in the major must be taken at Santa Clara. A single upper-division course in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science may not be used to satisfy requirements for two majors or minors.

Students should decide their emphasis by the end of junior year.

In place of MATH 165 or 166, a student may select an upper-division computer science course, **but two of the three courses must be designated MATH.** MATH 100, 192, 195, and CSCI 192 do not count toward the minor.

Preparation in Mathematics for Admission to Teacher Training Credential Programs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The State of California requires that students seeking a credential to teach mathematics or computer science in California secondary schools must pass the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET), a subject area competency examination. The secondary teaching credential additionally requires the completion of an approved credential program, which can be completed as a fifth year of study and student teaching, or through an undergraduate summer program internship. Students who are contemplating secondary school teaching in mathematics or computer science should consult with the coordinator in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science as early as possible.
