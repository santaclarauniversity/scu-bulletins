The Department of Theatre and Dance celebrates the creativity of the human spirit, offering a well-rounded education that leads to a bachelor of arts degree in Theatre Arts with emphasis in either theatre or dance. The department also offers minors in theatre, dance, theatre design and technology and musical theatre (an interdisciplinary minor offered in collaboration with the Department of Music). The program emphasizes academic rigor, artistic discipline, and creative expression. All students work closely with faculty and staff mentors. Majors fulfill all requirements set forth by the Undergraduate Core Curriculum, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Department of Theatre and Dance.

Theatre and dance are distinct but related areas of emphasis. While each has its own set of disciplinary standards and academic requirements, students in each emphasis share some common courses (e.g., Introduction to Performance Collaboration, Defining the Performing Artist, etc.)

The theatre emphasis offers coordinated courses in acting, design, theatre history, dramatic literature, technical production, directing, and playwriting. Students with this emphasis will have a broad foundation in theatrical practice and may choose to focus their study in any of the aforementioned areas. The dance emphasis offers coordinated classes in modern/contemporary dance, choreography, dance history, and provides additional training in ballet, jazz, hip-hop, and ethnic dance forms. Majors in either emphasis will complete their program with a senior project that demonstrates their proficiency in a chosen area.

All students are encouraged to be creative in taking responsibility for their undergraduate education, working with advisors and mentors to plan programs that marry courses in their focus areas to other disciplines. Since courses in theatre and dance provide students with invaluable experience in collaboration, critical thinking, organizational management, and effective communication skills, they may profitably combine a major in theatre arts with a major (or minor) in almost any other discipline---especially English, music, communication, art, psychology, the sciences, or business.

A degree in theatre arts prepares students for a variety of career options. Some students pursue graduate study in specialized focus areas so as to become professional theatre or dance artists and teachers. Others pursue careers in professional theatre or dance companies immediately after graduation. Still others have created their own theatre or dance companies or have ventured into the world of film, television, arts administration, and education. Many have used their performing arts experience to pursue careers in law, medicine, business, and marketing and development.

The performance season, sponsored by the department, includes four faculty-directed plays and two dance concerts, in addition to student-directed plays and dance recitals. Participation in these productions is open to all members of the University community---students, faculty, and staff. Guest artists regularly direct, design, choreograph, and/or perform in productions with SCU students.
