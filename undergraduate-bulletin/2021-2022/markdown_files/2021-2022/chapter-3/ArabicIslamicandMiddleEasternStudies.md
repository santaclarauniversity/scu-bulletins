Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies
===========================================

*Director:* David Skinner

The interdisciplinary minor in Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies (AIMES) provides an introduction to the various cultures, peoples, and religions---Muslim, Jewish, and Christian, in addition to other faith traditions---of the Middle East, as well as the diverse forms of Islamic practice and local religious customs in Muslim societies throughout the world. This program also encourages the study of diaspora and immigrant communities where Islamic and Middle Eastern populations constitute a religious or ethnic minority.

Students enrolled in this minor have the opportunity to sample a variety of methodologies and academic disciplines---including anthropology, art history, literary criticism, history, political science, and religious studies---that address the Middle East in particular and the Islamic world at large.

The AIMES interdisciplinary minor is ideal for students who want to develop the intellectual resources for thoughtful and informed engagement with current issues in the Middle East and the Islamic world. AIMES is also well suited for students considering work with overseas aid organizations, government and military service, international business, or graduate programs in international studies.

Requirements for the Minor
--------------------------

Students must complete a total of nine courses---six culture courses and three Arabic language courses---for a minor in AIMES. Details concerning these requirements are as follows:

**Culture Courses**

Students must take a total of six culture courses relating to AIMES (two lower-level and four upper-level) from at least three different departments. No more than two courses may be counted for AIMES credit from the department in which a student majors. A maximum of three courses for AIMES credit may be taken from any one department.

**Arabic Language**

Three quarters of Arabic are required. Students with prior knowledge of a relevant language may take a test that certifies that they have fulfilled this requirement.

**Senior Project**

In lieu of one of the six required courses in Middle Eastern and Islamic cultures, students may elect to do an independent study/reading course on a project in consultation with a member of the AIMES Faculty Advisory Council. This project may entail fieldwork with local Islamic and diaspora Middle Eastern communities in the Bay Area.

Students enrolled in the AIMES minor are strongly encouraged to participate in SCU-approved study abroad programs that pertain to Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern studies. Before enrolling in any such program, students should check with the director and faculty members of the AIMES minor as well as the Global Engagement Office.
