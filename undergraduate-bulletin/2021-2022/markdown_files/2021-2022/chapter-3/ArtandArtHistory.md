The Department of Art and Art History offers degree programs leading to the bachelor of arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both disciplines fostering a thorough understanding of the history and practice of art. Department faculty encourage interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara community through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of college and undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements, as well as offering courses through the University Honors Program.

Art History
-----------

Art history majors at Santa Clara examine the broad range of human visual expression across space and time, developing understandings of the meanings and purposes of the visual arts, including their historical development, roles in society, and relationships to other fields in the humanities. Students benefit from a program distinguished by excellent teaching and mentoring, challenging coursework, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, and student internships at local and Bay Area institutions. The art history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth that help students learn to think critically and communicate clearly about works of art. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in our annual Art History Symposium and the Art History Research Paper Competition. The art history major develops the following skills: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysis of visual objects and textual sources, advanced research and writing skills, and sophisticated oral presentations. The cultural understanding and intellectual skills developed through the program enable art history majors to pursue a variety of interests in a wide spectrum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history.

Studio Art
----------

Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or careers in either the fine or commercial arts. Faculty members emphasize the development of conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student's own work and that of others. By graduation, every studio art major develops a body of original artwork to be exhibited in a senior show for display in the department gallery space. In conjunction with the senior show, students are required to articulate an artist's statement reflecting their own engagement with the creative process, in conjunction with their senior show. Studio art majors enjoy opportunities to present their artwork in regional conferences as well as in student-organized exhibitions on and off campus. At the end of each academic year, students are encouraged to submit their work to the Annual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professional in the field of art. The Department also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are awarded to outstanding studio art majors with junior standing.

### 22. Art in the Age of Exploration: Introduction to Early Modern Europe

Few periods in the history of art inspire greater reverence than the Renaissance. But why? What enables objects such as Michelangelo's *David* or Leonardo's *Mona Lisa* to become pop culture icons in the 21st century? This survey course of European visual culture from approximately 1348 to 1648 seeks to answer this question through the study of canonical works; artists such as Raphael, Titian, and Dürer; and artistic centers including Venice, Florence, Rome, and Paris. Other topics for discussion may include the patronage and production of art; the visual construction of gender identity; the relationship between art, science, and religion brought about by humanist study; and the impact of global trade and exploration on the development of European visual culture. Not open to students who have taken Art, Power, and Propaganda (ARTH 12A or HNRS 12A). (4 units)

Fulfills the Studio Art program modern or contemporary emphasis course requirement. Not open to students who have taken Art, Trade, and Cultural Exchange (ARTH 11A). (4 units)

### 24. From Damascus to Dubai: A Survey of the Visual Culture of the Middle East

From the majesty of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem to the awe-inspiring heights of the Abu Dubai skyline, few regions boast a history of ambitious art and architecture as long, and as impressive, as the Middle East. Yet, this region is likewise one of the most misunderstood. This survey course focuses on the rich and diverse visual culture of the region from the 7th century CE to the present day. Topics for discussion include early mosque architecture, scientific developments in medieval Baghdad, the rise of the Ottoman Empire, the garden city of Isfahan, European colonialism in North Africa, and contemporary art and architecture.

Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units)

### 26. Art! Making China Modern 

On the long march from dynastic regime to global power, artmade China modern on its own terms. In the 19th century writers, politicians, and revolutionaries looked to Japan and Europe to learn how art could renovate the nation. After WWI, leftists weaponized woodcuts and folk arts to combat the forces of Japan and the U.S.-backed Nationalists. At the dawn of the People's Republic, art reorganized society and fueled radical conformity. As China globalized, artists cashed in on burgeoning markets, grappled with legacies, sounded alarms about oppression, and questioned "The Chinese Dream." Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units)

### 30. The Built Environment

The Built Environment examines the human factors responsible for shaping the spaces in which we live and work. The course focuses on architecture from around the globe, from the onset of the industrial age to the present day.

Students will visit local sites of architectural merit and will learn Neatline, a geospatial mapping software, to present their research findings. Fulfills the Studio Art Program modern or contemporary emphasis course requirement. (4 units)

### 66. Fabricating Nature in East Asia

Across East Asia, artists and designers have fabricated landscapes to marshal natural forces for human-centered purposes. In China, visualizing Confucian and Daoist principles through paintings and gardens ordered society and cultivated individuals. In Korea, artists interpreted imported religions and philosophies through indigenous beliefs, giving birth to True View painting and *seowon* rural campuses. Japan's native Shintō steered Buddhism in new directions, culminating in Zen and *roji* tea gardens. Today, these religions, philosophies, aesthetics, and practices remain vigorous, exerting themselves in art and landscape design worldwide, offering solutions to environmental challenges, and alternatives to the isolation of modern life. Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units)

This course will take you through a survey of modern Indian art in the 20th century. We will see how Indian artists constantly engaged with and responded to modernity and the modernisms they encountered in the global art world, while working through late-colonial, post-independence and contemporary Indian contexts. Early modern artists of the Bengal School of art grappled with the question of how to be "modern" and "Indian" in their search for an "Indian-ness" devoid of Western elements, while post-independence artists of the Progressive Artists Group could freely work with both Western modernism and Indian idioms toward self-expression. We will see how this trajectory moves into contemporary art and also contextualize feminism by reading about the works of women artists from varied backgrounds. Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units)

### 120. Keeping up with the Medici: Fame and Family in Renaissance Florence

What makes someone a "household name"? Is it talent, beauty, connections, or simply shrewd marketing? While fame, fortune, and celebrity may seem like modern phenomena, the cult of personality was equally prominent in Renaissance Florence. As is the case today, money played a key role in the arts. This course focuses on the ways in which the Medici family, through their social, financial, and spiritual support, transformed the city of Florence from an Italian commune with limited natural resources into the center of the European culture. And in doing so, transformed the notion of the artist from that of mere craftsman to superstar. Additional topics of discussion include the influence of the capitalist economics on artistic production, domestic art perceptions of the nude figure in religious paintings, the relationship between art and science, and the writings of Machiavelli. Cross-listed as HIST 125. (5 units)

### 121. Venice and the Other in the Renaissance

Concentrates on the art and architecture of the Venetian Republic from approximately 1400--1650 CE, specifically the visual culture produced by and/or associated with ethnic and social groups excluded from the highest echelons of Venetian society.

(5 units)

### 123. The Global Renaissance

The "Renaissance" has traditionally been viewed as a period of artistic and cultural development associated almost exclusively with the Italian peninsula in the 15th and 16th century. This same tradition privileges "high art"---that is, painting, sculpture, and architecture over other forms of visual culture. This course seeks to reassess these notions by considering Italian Renaissance art within the context of early modern globalism. This reexamination likewise mandates a consideration of a broader spectrum of objects, including gemstones, glassware, and textiles. Topics such as the relationship between Michelangelo, Leonardo, and the Ottoman architect Sinan, the collection of Aztec feather paintings by the Medici family, and the influence of Egyptian mosque architecture on Venetian palace design will be examined from an interdisciplinary perspective.

Students will learn about the roles of American women in the visual arts and the active interplay between issues embedded in art and in "craft"; women's self-fashioning and the art market; images of women; and the impact of women's studies and feminism on the study of the visual arts. Close readings of images and objects spanning traditional and nontraditional media such as painting, sculpture, photography, embroidery, and quilting produce insights into the dynamic relationships between gender and art, culture, and commerce in American history. Fulfills the Studio Art program modern or contemporary emphasis course requirement. Also listed as WGST 156. Prerequisite: one ARTH course or permission of instructor. (5 units)

### 144. Race, Gender, and Nation in 18th- and 19th-Century American Art

What did visual and material arts from the Colonial period to the Gilded Age (1880s) look like and how did they function in colonial society and help to shape a new, fast-growing nation?

### 166. From Emaki to Manga

For over a millennium, Japanese artists have used pictorial narratives to circulate ideas and explore emotions. Buddhist Jataka tales inspired devotion, while emaki handscrolls explored romantic longing concealed beneath courtly protocols. Explicit and grotesque visions of hell admonished men and women for separate sins. As Japan modernized, prints and manga celebrated urbanism and imperialism, and bore witness to atrocities. Inherent in these ancient and contemporary narratives are changing concepts of gender as artists have negotiated and challenged the dynamics between male and female authors and subjects, as well as universal themes and indigenous aesthetics. Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (5 units)

### 181. Animated Spaces: The Hindu Temple and its Global Forms
