Experiential Learning for Social Justice
========================================

*Assessment Manager for Undergraduate Studies:* Andrea Brewster

The Experiential Learning for Social Justice (ELSJ) component of Santa Clara's Core Curriculum cultivates social justice, civic life, perspective, and civic engagement. To echo the words of Fr. Kolvenbach: ELSJ provides Santa Clara students with opportunities for experiencing the gritty reality of the world, thinking critically about the world, responding to its suffering, and engaging it constructively.

The majority of courses satisfying the Core ELSJ requirement are offered by University academic departments and programs. However, students may also satisfy the requirement through the following courses.

### ELSJ 9. ELSJ Milestone: Post-immersion Reflection and Analysis

Enrolled students will participate in a pre-approved Ignatian Center immersion in advance of the course. Coursework will allow students to reflect on the immersion experience and explore what it means to live in solidarity with our local and global community. Students will strengthen their ability to work sensitively and respectfully with communities that are socially, economically, and/or politically marginalized or oppressed. Course assignments include critical reflections and an academic research paper. Enrollment by permission only. Permission must be granted by the assessment manager for Undergraduate Studies in advance of beginning the immersion experience. (1 unit)

### ELSJ 22. Solidarity with the Community

This course will explore what it means to live in solidarity with our local and global community. Students will strengthen their ability to work sensitively and respectfully with communities that are socially, economically, and/or politically marginalized or oppressed. Enrolled students will participate in a weekly community-based learning placement through Arrupe Weekly Engagement or a similar program where students are engaged with communities. Note: This course requires participation in community-based learning (CBL) experiences off campus. (2 units)

### ELSJ 23. Careers for the Common Good

This course will expose students to social realities and injustices both locally and internationally, providing an understanding of the complex relations between privileged and marginalized groups. Through reflection, self-assessments, course speakers, Career Center resources, and a community-based learning placement, students will be able to articulate their interests and talents and the applications to particular needs in the world. Students will be given the tools and resources to pursue a career direction and make life decisions that are personally meaningful and socially beneficial. This course is appropriate for students in any major. Note: This course requires participation in community-based learning (CBL) experiences off campus. (2 units)

### ELSJ 30. Discernment for Justice in the Jesuit Catholic Tradition

This course is offered in conjunction with the winter break Ecuador immersion provided through the Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education. Within the course, students will engage with themes such as the intersection of social justice and the Jesuit Catholic intellectual tradition, the relationship between faith and justice, the value and moral challenge of different economic systems, the preferential option for the poor, and discernment of vocation. This course will facilitate integration of the experience of immersion with lived experience upon return to Santa Clara and beyond. Enrollment by instructor permission only. (2 units)

### ELSJ 50. Law and Social Justice

This course provides a theoretical, vocational, and legal doctrinal foundation for students interested in social justice law. The assigned reading offers an opportunity to consider the relationship between law and social justice in several different contexts, including the structure of the legal profession and the delivery of legal services; the efforts to achieve social justice and civil rights through litigation in areas such as work, subsistence, housing, voting, and education; the problem of access to courts and the role of the judiciary; and the role of lawyers working with community movements to affect social change. To ground these theoretical explorations in real-life practice, this course features a community-based learning component, enabling students to interact with real people for whom these issues matter. This course satisfies both the ELSJ requirement and the Civic Engagement requirement, and qualifies as part of the Social Justice Pathway in the University's Core Curriculum. Note: This course requires participation in community-based learning (CBL) experiences off campus. (4 units)
