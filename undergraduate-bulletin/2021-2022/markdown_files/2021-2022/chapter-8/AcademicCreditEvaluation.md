Academic Credit Evaluation
==========================

Santa Clara awards credit based on the Advanced Placement Program, the International Baccalaureate Program, University of Cambridge International Examinations, courses completed at other accredited colleges and universities, and courses completed in University-approved study abroad and domestic study programs using the criteria outlined herein. Students are allowed to transfer in a maximum of one-half of the total quarter units required to graduate in their specific program. Students may not take a SCU course for credit for which they have already received transfer credit. Santa Clara University does not allow students to receive duplicate credit for courses. You can either receive test credit for a course or take the course at SCU, but not both. Credit is not awarded for the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP).

Advanced Placement (AP) Credit
------------------------------

Santa Clara participates in the Advanced Placement Program to recognize college-level academic achievement prior to matriculation and to encourage students to pursue advanced studies in their areas of interest. Credit or placement is determined by the appropriate department based on review of the student's Advanced Placement scores, sometimes in the context of supplemental departmental examinations.

Note: students who are awarded credit for exams taken in Spring 2020 that covered a shortened curriculum and who wish to enroll in the next level course at Santa Clara University should consult with their department and/or advisor to ensure they will not be at a disadvantage in that field of study.

The following chart indicates the subject examination, required scores, and Santa Clara credit granted through the Advanced Placement tests. Courses waived will always satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum.

Courses waived by AP test scores, when relevant, may satisfy Second Language, Mathematics, Natural Science, and Social Science requirements in the Core Curriculum. No other undergraduate Core requirement can be satisfied with AP test scores.

Final decisions on academic credit for some AP scores are made individually by the appropriate academic department in consultation with the Office of the Registrar.

International Baccalaureate
---------------------------

Santa Clara University recognizes the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program for admission and advanced placement.

Note: students who are awarded credit for IB coursework taken in Spring 2020 and who wish to enroll in the next level course at Santa Clara University should consult with their department and/or advisor to ensure they will not be at a disadvantage in that field of study.

The following chart indicates the subject examination, required scores, and Santa Clara credit granted through the International Baccalaureate high level (HL) tests. Courses waived will always satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum.

Courses waived by IB (HL) scores, when relevant, may satisfy Arts, Second Language, Mathematics, Natural Science, and Social Science requirements in the Core Curriculum. No other undergraduate Core requirement can be satisfied with IB test scores.

No credit is awarded for IB subsidiary level (SL) examinations. Final decisions on academic credit for some IB scores are made individually by the appropriate academic department in consultation with the Office of the Registrar.

University of Cambridge International Examinations
--------------------------------------------------

Santa Clara University accepts selected University of Cambridge International Advanced (A) Level examinations with letter grades of A (a) or B (b). Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Ordinary (O) Level examinations are not awarded credit. Final decisions on academic credit for A Level subject examinations are made individually by the appropriate academic department in consultation with the University Registrar. Courses waived will satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum.

Transfer Credit and the Core Curriculum
---------------------------------------

All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; Religion, Theology & Culture; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for Social Justice; and Pathways. For all other Core requirements, it is possible for students to earn credit by taking Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, or by completing college-level courses prior to enrolling at Santa Clara.

Transfer credit earned from courses completed before enrollment at Santa Clara is governed by two sets of rules: One for students admitted as first-year students and another for transfer students.

Students admitted as first-year students must satisfy Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2, and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3 with courses completed at Santa Clara University.

In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 before their first quarter at Santa Clara.

Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in the required sequence. In addition, students must complete their Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 at Santa Clara University if the student does not have transfer credit to fulfill both courses in the sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, must complete two courses from the Religion, Theology & Culture sequence in any order.

Transfer students must declare their Pathways by the end of their third quarter at SCU. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units must take four courses (minimum of 16 units) to fulfill the Pathways requirement. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) to fulfill the Pathways requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) to fulfill the Pathways requirement. More detailed Pathway guidelines are available on the [Pathways website](https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/pathways/).

Transfer credit earned from courses completed after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill Core Curriculum or other requirements. A maximum number of 10 quarter units of free elective transfer credit can be awarded.

Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the chapter(s) relevant to their school or college for additional relevant information.

Units Taken at Other Institutions
---------------------------------

Credit is awarded for coursework completed at other accredited colleges and universities subject to certain limitations. Courses are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses of a trade or technical nature do not transfer. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer.

Transfer students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities prior to matriculation at Santa Clara for no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for the specific Santa Clara degree. After enrolling at Santa Clara, students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities for no more than 10 quarter units of free electives, subject to the limitation that no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for a Santa Clara degree can be earned at another institution. Transfer credit earned after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill undergraduate Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or program requirements.

Transfer credit for all coursework completed at other colleges and universities requires approval from the Office of the Registrar and the chair of the department offering the equivalent Santa Clara course. The student must have earned a grade of "C" or better in a course for transfer credit to be granted. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not accepted as transfer credit (Note below, the exception being made to Spring 2020 term course work)**.** Grades for units earned at other institutions are not included in a student's Santa Clara academic history or in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average.

(Note: Exception for Spring 2020 term: Regarding transfer credits for work completed in Spring Term 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, course work receiving a grade of Pass or Credit is transferable. We encourage students continuing on in those subject areas to consult with their departments and advisors to ensure they are adequately prepared for the next level courses.)

Study Abroad and Domestic Study Programs
----------------------------------------

Qualified undergraduate students may apply to study abroad for a quarter, semester, or summer term in a country and academic environment that will enrich their overall college experience, contribute positively to the life of the University, and engender responsible participation in a global, multicultural society.

Units and grades earned through study abroad programs and domestic off-campus study programs that have been approved through regular University processes are included on the Santa Clara University transcript and may be used to fulfill major, minor, and Core requirements with prior approval by the department chair or Core director. Grades earned in approved study abroad and domestic off-campus study programs are included in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. The third-level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology & Culture cannot be fulfilled with a study abroad course.

Units earned for coursework in study abroad and domestic off-campus study programs not approved by the University through the regular application process are subject to the policies governing transfer credit and may not fulfill major, minor, or Core requirements. See the sections on transfer credit earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 7.
