The Cowell Center
=================

The Cowell Center promotes a holistic approach to students' physical, emotional, psychological, and interpersonal well-being. The Center's counseling and medical staff are available when students believe that their well-being is being compromised in any way. Through Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), Student Health Services (SHS), Santa Clara University Emergency Medical Services (SCU EMS), and Student Health Insurance, the Cowell Center has a wealth of health and wellness resources to support students as they navigate the academic rigors at Santa Clara University.

Counseling and Psychological Services
-------------------------------------

Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is staffed with psychologists who strive to promote, enhance, and support students' emotional and interpersonal well-being through a range of mental health services offered within a safe and confidential environment. Individual counseling, couples counseling, group counseling, and psychoeducational programs are available. In counseling, students work on a wide range of psychosocial and developmental issues such as depression, anxiety, interpersonal problems, disturbed sleep, eating behaviors, acculturation, academic motivation, homesickness, family concerns, intimacy, and sexuality. All students are eligible for up to 10 counseling sessions per academic year; the first six (6) sessions are free, with a nominal fee assessed for sessions seven (7) through ten (10).

When CAPS is closed, an after-hours emergency and suicide crisis hotline (408-279-3312) is available to students along with Santa Clara's unique crisis webpage featured on the [Ulifeline website](http://www.ulifeline.org/scu/).

Student Health Services
-----------------------

Student Health Services (SHS) is staffed with a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and medical assistants. A psychiatrist, registered dietitian, and physical therapy assistant are available on a part-time basis. SHS provides high-quality services, such as primary medical care, physicals, diagnosis and treatment of illness and injuries, immunizations, gynecological examinations, a limited in-house pharmacy, and medical referrals to specialists when needed. Medical visits to the Cowell Center's Student Health Services range from \$10 to \$50 per visit for all students. Visit fees are in addition to all other nominal associated fees, such as the cost of medications, lab/blood tests, and supplies. Visits to Cowell Center's Counseling and Psychological Services range in cost from no charge to \$100 per visit for all students. For further information, see the [Cowell Center website](https://www.scu.edu/cowell/). When SHS is closed, an advice nurse is available by phone for students both on campus (extension 4880) and off campus (408-554-4880). A volunteer student emergency medical group, SCU Emergency Medical Services (EMS), is also available to take care of medical emergencies on campus. The health center is closed from mid-June to mid-August.

SCU Emergency Medical Services
------------------------------

SCU Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is a student-run organization that is based out of the Cowell Center. These students are known as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and offer emergency medical services to SCU students from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. every day during fall, winter, and spring quarters.

Student Health Insurance
------------------------

All students are requested to complete a pre-entrance health history prior to arrival at the University, and are required to maintain health insurance coverage while enrolled at the University. Students will be charged for University health insurance unless they complete an online waiver verifying their own comparable insurance each academic year.
