"},"chapter-1/SantaClaraUniversity.html":{"url":"chapter-1/SantaClaraUniversity.html","title":"Chapter 1: Santa Clara University","keywords":"","body":"Santa Clara University Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Santa Clara University is a comprehensive Jesuit, Catholic university with more than 8,800 students. Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, law, engineering, education, counseling psychology, pastoral ministries, and theology. The University boasts a diverse community of scholars offering a values-oriented curriculum characterized by small class sizes and a dedication to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education---educating the whole person for a life of service---run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs. Santa Clara University is perennially ranked among the top comprehensive universities by U.S. News & World Report and has one of the highest graduation rates for undergraduate students among all comprehensive universities. The University has a national reputation for its undergraduate program that features a distinctive core curriculum, an integrated learning environment, and research opportunities for undergraduate students. The University was established as Santa Clara College on the site of Mission Santa Clara de Asís, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally operated as a preparatory school and did not offer collegiate courses until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. One-third of the students were enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college's preparatory and high school departments. Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added. In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business opened in 1926, and within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the country to receive national accreditation. For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admission explosion---from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began the largest building program in school history, erecting eight residence halls, a student union, and an athletic stadium. In 1985, the University adopted \"Santa Clara University\" as its official name. "},"chapter-1/UniversityMission.html":{"url":"chapter-1/UniversityMission.html","title":"University Vision, Mission, and Fundamental Values","keywords":"","body":"University Vision, Mission, and Fundamental Values Santa Clara University has adopted three directional statements to describe the kind of university it aspires to become (Strategic Vision), its core purpose and the constituencies it serves (University Mission), and the beliefs that guide its actions (Fundamental Values). Strategic Vision Santa Clara University will educate citizens and leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion, and cultivate knowledge and faith to build a more humane, just, and sustainable world. University Mission The University pursues its vision by creating an academic community that educates the whole person within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition, making student learning our central focus, continuously improving our curriculum and co-curriculum, strengthening our scholarship and creative work, and serving the communities of which we are a part in Silicon Valley and around the world. Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educational environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institutional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society. We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to the development of: Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily residential setting Graduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contributions to their fields In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for non-matriculated students. Fundamental Values The University is committed to these core values, which guide us in carrying out our mission and realizing our vision: Academic Excellence. We seek an uncompromising standard of excellence in teaching, learning, creativity, and scholarship within and across disciplines. Search for Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. We prize scholarship and creative work that advance human understanding, improve teaching and learning, and add to the betterment of society by illuminating the most significant problems of the day and exploring the enduring mysteries of life. In this search, our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering. Engaged Learning. We strive to integrate academic reflection and direct experience in the classroom and the community, especially to understand and improve the lives of those with the least education, power, and wealth. Commitment to Students. As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, we endeavor to educate the whole person. We nurture and challenge students---intellectually, spiritually, aesthetically, morally, socially, and physically---preparing them for leadership and service to the common good in their professional, civic, and personal lives. Service to Others. We promote throughout the University a culture of service---service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its most disadvantaged members as we work with and for others to build a more humane, just, faith-filled, and sustainable world. Community and Diversity. We cherish our diverse and inclusive community of students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni, a community that is enriched by people of different backgrounds, respectful of the dignity of all its members, enlivened by open communication, and caring and just toward others. Jesuit Distinctiveness. We treasure our Jesuit heritage and tradition, which incorporates all of these core values. This tradition gives expression to our Jesuit educational mission and Catholic identity while also welcoming and respecting other religious and philosophical traditions, promoting the dialogue between faith and culture, and valuing opportunities to deepen religious beliefs.

"},"chapter-1/Campus.html":{"url":"chapter-1/Campus.html","title":"Campus","keywords":"","body":"Campus The University is located on a 106-acre campus in the city of Santa Clara near the southern end of the San Francisco Bay in one of the world's greatest cultural centers. More than 50 buildings on campus house 15 student residences, a main library, a law library, two student centers, the de Saisset Museum, extensive performing arts and athletic facilities, and a recreation and fitness center. Santa Clara's campus has the advantage of being located in Silicon Valley, a region known for its extraordinary visionaries, who have designed and created some of the most significant scientific and technological advances of our age. Silicon Valley is more than a location---it is a mindset, and home to more than 3 million residents and 6,600 science- and technology-related companies (not including San Francisco, which is located just an hour away). Santa Clara's campus is well known for its beauty and mission-style architecture. Opened in 2013, the brick-paved Abby Sobrato Mall leads visitors from the University's main entrance to the heart of campus---the Mission Santa Clara de Asís. The roses and palm and olive trees of the Mission Gardens surround the historic Mission Church, which was restored in 1928. The adjacent Adobe Lodge is the oldest building on campus. In 1981, it was restored to its 1822 decor. Academic Facilities Amidst all this beauty and history are modern, world-class academic facilities. Students study and thrive in places such as the Joanne E. Harrington Learning Commons, Sobrato Family Technology Center, and Orradre Library, where individuals and groups can study in an inviting, light-filled, and open environment. Notably, the library features an Automated Retrieval System, a high-density storage area where up to 900,000 books and other publications can be stored and retrieved using robotic-assisted technology. Another example of Santa Clara's excellent academic facilities is Lucas Hall, home of the Leavey School of Business. This modern 85,000-square-foot building houses classrooms, meeting rooms, offices, study spaces, and a café. Classrooms are equipped with state-of-the-art videoconferencing equipment as well as a multiplatform system to record faculty lectures for later review by students. Vari Hall (formerly Arts & Sciences), adjacent to Lucas Hall, is home to the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics as well as academic departments, classrooms, and a 2,200-square-foot digital television studio, regarded as among the best studios found on any campus nationwide. Located near Vari Hall is the Schott Admission and Enrollment Services Building, a welcome center for campus visitors and home to several University departments. Opened in 2012, the lobby of this LEED Gold equivalent structure includes technology-infused exhibits that illustrate Santa Clara's Jesuit mission. Among other green features on campus are two solar-powered homes built in 2007 and 2009 for the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon. Both homes now serve as laboratories for solar and sustainability technologies. University Library & Learning Commons The Santa Clara University Library & Learning Commons is a central hub for students to study and collaborate. The Learning Commons has a mix of both individual and group seating, group study rooms, computer labs, outside patios, as well as a cafe on the first floor. Throughout the year, the University Library hosts events, art exhibits, and late-night hours. Library staff are available to support student research. You can contact library staff in person at the Library Help Desk, by making an appointment online, or through our 24/7 chat service, \"Ask a Librarian.\" The Library's Archives & Special Collections provides access to rare books, manuscripts, historic photos, and artifacts. Library resources, which can be accessed within the Learning Commons and remotely, include an online catalog (OSCAR), over 250 general and subject-specific databases, research guides for many subjects and classes, and interlibrary loan programs. The library's collection includes books, ebooks, magazines, newspapers and journals, streaming videos, and more.

Student Life Santa Clara has unique Residential Learning Communities (RLC) spread through nine on-campus residence halls; some with suite arrangements conducive to more informal living; others with traditional double rooms and large common bathrooms. Juniors and seniors can apply for townhouse-style living in the 138-unit University Villas across from the main campus. The most recent RLC, Cura, is located in Finn Hall and opened in the fall of 2019. The Cura RLC is a mini-suite style, co-ed community of first and second-year students, focused on the theme of cura personalis or care for the whole person. The Robert F. Benson Memorial Center serves as a hub for campus life. The Benson Memorial Center offers dining services and houses the campus bookstore, student and administrative offices, lounges, and meeting rooms. The University's main dining hall, The Marketplace, resembles an upscale food court with numerous stations and options. For a more informal experience, The Bronco is the Center's late-night venue, serving beverages and pub-style food. Another hot-spot for student life, the Paul L. Locatelli, S.J., Student Activity Center, includes a 6,000 square-foot gathering hall with a high ceiling that can accommodate dances and concerts as well as pre- and post-game activities. Designed with environmental sensitivity, the building is energy efficient and has daytime lighting controls and motion sensors to maximize use of natural light. For fitness-minded students, the Pat Malley Fitness and Recreation Center features a 9,500-square-foot weight training and cardiovascular exercise room, three basketball courts, a swimming pool, an adjacent outdoor workout area, sand volleyball, and basketball court, and other facilities to support the recreational and fitness needs of the campus community. The campus includes many locations for quiet reflection, such as the St. Clare Garden, which features plants and flowers arranged into five groups to portray the stages of the saint's life. For campus members who want a more hands-on relationship with nature, the Forge Garden, SCU's half-acre organic garden, serves as a campus space for course research, service learning, and sustainable food production. Athletics and the Arts The importance of athletics to the University is evident everywhere on campus. Among the newest additions to Santa Clara's athletics facilities are the Stephen Schott Stadium, home field for the men's baseball team, and the state-of-the-art Stevens Soccer Training Center, funded by a gift from Mary and Mark Stevens. The gift also allowed Santa Clara to upgrade the stands in Stevens Stadium (formerly Buck Shaw Stadium), home to the men's and women's soccer programs, and build a plaza to celebrate Bronco sports---its past, present, and future. The plaza celebrates the history of Santa Clara University football as well as the legacy and future of men's and women's soccer at SCU. Bellomy Field, eight acres of well-lit and grassy playing fields, provides space for club and intramural sports, such as rugby and field hockey. Adjacent to Bellomy Field is the well-appointed women's softball field, which opened in 2013. The Leavey Event Center houses the University's premier basketball facility. Over the years, the Leavey Event Center has hosted nine West Coast Conference Basketball Championships. The University recognizes the arts as a central part of life at Santa Clara University. The Edward M. Dowd Art and Art History Building opened in 2016, houses an integrated art history and fine arts program that is a center for inspiration, innovation, and engagement in the arts and art history in Silicon Valley. An important arts destination in the Bay Area, the Department of Art and Art History\\s gallery exhibits artwork from a diverse group of established and emerging artists, and provides a dynamic teaching and learning resource for faculty, staff, students and the community. The de Saisset Museum, the University's accredited museum of art and history, presents changing art exhibitions throughout the year and serves as the caretaker of the University's California History Collection, which includes artifacts from the Native American, Mission, and early Santa Clara College periods. SCU•Presents represents the University's commitment to the performing arts on campus, which includes performances at venues such as the Louis B. Mayer Theatre, the Fess Parker Studio Theatre, and the Music Recital Hall. The Mayer Theatre is Santa Clara University's premier theatrical venue, housing 500 intimate seats in either a flexible proscenium or thrust-stage setting. The Fess Parker Studio Theatre has no fixed stage or seating. Its black box design, complete with movable catwalks, provides flexibility in an experimental setting. The 250-seat Music Recital Hall provides a contemporary setting where students, faculty, and guest artists offer a variety of performances. "},"chapter-2/TransformativeExperiencesandLearningResources.html":{"url":"chapter-2/TransformativeExperiencesandLearningResources.html","title":"Chapter 2: Transformative Experiences and Learning Resources","keywords":"","body":"Transformative Experiences and Learning Resources Santa Clara University is committed to the education of the whole person in the Jesuit and Catholic tradition, with a vision of developing people to be leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion. The undergraduate program is designed for students who seek an education that integrates Jesuit values and learning that prepares them for 21st-century challenges in a primarily residential setting. Varied educational experiences encourage students to value differing ways of knowing and being in the world, different forms of knowledge within established disciplines, and new knowledge as well as that which preceded it. Santa Clara's concept of the \"whole person\" inevitably embraces our social nature. When he inaugurated Santa Clara's sesquicentennial year in 2000, Fr. Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then superior general of the Society of Jesus, noted that \"Tomorrow's 'whole person' cannot be whole without an educated awareness of society and culture with which to contribute socially, generously, in the real world.\" Affirming that the Jesuit educational standard must always \"educate the whole person of solidarity for the real world,\" he explained: \"Students, in the course of their formation, must let the gritty reality of this world into their lives, so they can learn to feel it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering, and engage in it constructively. They should learn to perceive, think, judge, choose, and act for the rights of others, especially the disadvantaged and the oppressed.\" Since then, Santa Clara University has revised the Core Curriculum, implemented a new Integrated Strategic Plan, extended the impact of its Centers of Excellence, and enhanced the University's cocurricular programs, all with the goal of educating students who will apply what they are learning to constructive engagement with the gritty realities of the 21st century. The Santa Clara undergraduate program offers courses and other learning experiences whose content and patterns combine the acquisition and creation of knowledge with the quest for meaning and purpose. Santa Clara's learning environments encourage students to make connections across the Core Curriculum, the academic major, elective courses, and cocurricular experiences. Students are encouraged to relate their classroom learning with out-of-classroom learning through community-based education, Residential Learning Communities, Campus Ministry, a wide variety of student organizations, athletics and recreation, and other experiences. In a more general way, the undergraduate program nurtures students' ability to knit the intellectual, social, moral, spiritual, creative, and behavioral aspects of life into a coherent and meaningful whole. "},"chapter-2/TheCoreCurriculum.html":{"url":"chapter-2/TheCoreCurriculum.html","title":"The Core Curriculum","keywords":"","body":"The Core Curriculum A university expresses its most basic values in its Core Curriculum that is part of an undergraduate education required of all students. Santa Clara's Core Curriculum explicitly integrates three traditions of higher education. As a Catholic university, it is rooted in the tradition of pursuing an understanding of God through the free exercise of reason. As a Jesuit university, it promotes a humanistic education that leads toward ethical engagement with the world. As a comprehensive American university committed to liberal education, Santa Clara seeks to prepare its students for intelligent, responsible, and creative citizenship. Reflecting these traditions, the Core Curriculum provides every undergraduate with the common learning that all students need to become leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion. The distinctiveness of a Santa Clara education emerges in the Core Curriculum, both in its sense of purpose rooted in the University's traditions and in its commitment to a breadth of learning for the 21st century that complements and supports all majors. The Core Curriculum opens students to the study and practice of the arts, humanities, mathematics, technology, natural sciences, and social sciences. It educates students for interdisciplinary understanding and ethically informed participation in civic life. Opportunities for experiential learning foster the development of compassion and attention to the ways human suffering can be alleviated. Reflecting the University's founding mission, the Core Curriculum includes a disciplined and critical reflection on the religious dimensions of human existence. In addition, because the Core Curriculum continually highlights the critical and compelling questions facing individuals and communities, the Core Curriculum supports students both in making professional career choices and in discerning their larger vocation---their life's purpose in the world. Learning Goals: What will students learn in the Core Curriculum? Because a liberal education in the Jesuit tradition is oriented toward particular ends, the Core Curriculum affirms a set of central learning goals. These goals are divided among three broad categories: Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World. Knowledge To be prepared for well-informed engagement in society, students must comprehend the forces that have shaped the world they have inherited and the ways the world is interpreted and understood. They must also understand how they might transform the world for the better. The Core Curriculum deepens students' knowledge of the ideas and ways of knowing that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences. Global Cultures: The intertwined development of global ideas, institutions, religions, and cultures, including Western cultures Arts and Humanities: The production, interpretation, and social influence of the fine and performing arts, history, languages, literatures, philosophy, and religion Scientific Inquiry: The principles of scientific inquiry and how they are applied in the natural and social sciences Science and Technology: The formative influences, dynamics, social impacts, and ethical consequences of scientific and technological development Diversity: Diverse human experiences, identities, and cultures within local and global societies, especially as formed by relations of power and privilege Civic Life: The roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens and institutions in societies and in the world Habits of Mind and Heart To contribute to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world, students must develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that allow them to educate themselves for the rest of their lives with passion and purpose. By attending to the cognitive and affective dimensions of human experience, the Core Curriculum enables students to think more deeply, imagine more freely, and communicate more clearly. Critical Thinking: The ability to identify, reflect upon, evaluate, integrate, and apply different types of information and knowledge to form independent judgments Mathematics and Quantitative Reasoning: Analytical and logical thinking and the habit of drawing conclusions based on quantitative information Complexity: An approach to understanding the world that appreciates ambiguity and nuance as well as clarity and precision Ethical Reasoning: Drawing on ethical traditions to assess the consequences of individual and institutional decisions Religious Reflection: Questioning and clarifying beliefs through critical inquiry into faith and the religious dimensions of human existence Communication: Interacting effectively with different audiences, especially through writing, speech, and a second language Engagement with the World To engage with the world in meaningful ways, students need opportunities to explore and refine self-knowledge in relation to others. The Core Curriculum enhances students' understanding of the integrity of their own lives and the dignity inherent in the lives of others, especially the impoverished, suffering, and marginalized. Perspective: Seeking out the experience of different cultures and people, striving to view the world through their eyes Collaboration: The capacity to collaborate intellectually and creatively with diverse people Social Justice: Developing a disciplined sensibility toward the causes of human suffering and misery, and a sense of responsibility for addressing them Civic Engagement: Addressing major contemporary social issues, including environmental sustainability and peaceful resolution of conflict, by participating actively as an informed citizen of society and the world Each course in the Core Curriculum addresses at least three of the learning goals listed above. Students have multiple opportunities to encounter, practice, and master each learning goal. In addition, specific learning objectives for each area of the Core Curriculum have been developed by faculty Core Curriculum committees. These learning objectives are associated with particular learning goals and describe the knowledge, skills, and values students will be able to demonstrate after completing the courses in the Core Curriculum. The learning objectives are posted on the Core Curriculum website. Structure of the Core Curriculum The structure of the Core features three phases designed to foster developmental learning and curricular coherence. The first phase, Foundations, consists of courses normally taken in the first year, introducing students to the processes and expectations for university-level education: Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 Second Language (level required varies by major) Mathematics Religion, Theology & Culture 1 This phase helps students begin to set their own goals for learning, preparing them to make thoughtful choices in the Core Curriculum, their majors, and cocurricular activities. The second phase, Explorations, offers students the opportunity to choose among courses that will expand and deepen their understanding of a broad range of subject areas needed for effective participation in contemporary life as well as satisfy requirements in students' majors. Explorations requirements: Ethics Civic Engagement Diversity: U.S. Perspectives Arts Social Science Natural Science Science, Technology & Society Cultures & Ideas 3 Religion, Theology & Culture 2 Religion, Theology & Culture 3 Students in Arts and Sciences and Business satisfy their Core Foundations and Explorations requirements with one course per Core area. Engineering students may satisfy more than one Core requirement with a single course when the course has been approved for both Core areas. Students who double major across schools/colleges must complete the Core requirements for each of their programs. The third phase, Integrations, consists of these requirements: Experiential Learning for Social Justice Advanced Writing Pathways These Core components are often embedded in courses students take to fulfill other requirements. These courses offer students the opportunity to examine the connections between courses in different disciplines, between the classroom and the wider community, and between their coursework and the professions. Student progress through the Core Curriculum is not strictly sequential, from Foundations through Explorations to Integrations. While some courses (e.g., Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2; Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2; and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3) must be taken in sequence, all students have the opportunity to discover other sequences that are best for their individual undergraduate experience while engaging in coursework designed to address the shared set of learning objectives for each component of the Core Curriculum. Furthermore, the Integrations components of the Core Curriculum help students experience requirements not only as individual courses but as related educational activities that help structure and integrate their entire experience of University study. The Core Curriculum provides more detailed information about each component of the Core Curriculum, the learning goals and objectives associated with each component, the core policies, and the courses from which students may choose. Students are encouraged to check their degree audit in eCampus regularly to determine their progress in the Core Curriculum and other academic requirements. The Core Curriculum and the College of Arts and Sciences Students in the College of Arts and Sciences should consult Chapter 3 for the requirements for their majors. The Undergraduate Core Curriculum is designed to provide both a foundation and supplement to major requirements. The Core Curriculum and the Leavey School of Business Leavey School of Business requirements determine how students in the business school satisfy some Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements---some Core Curriculum requirements are fulfilled with courses that also apply to the Business Core Curriculum. Students in the Leavey School of Business should consult Chapter 4 for a complete list of requirements for their majors and the school. The Core Curriculum website provides additional information. The Core Curriculum and the School of Engineering Students in the School of Engineering are allowed more flexibility in their completion of Core requirements. Students in the School of Engineering should consult Chapter 5 for a complete list of requirements for their majors and the school. The Core Curriculum website provides additional information for how engineering students complete their Core requirements. Transfer Credit and the Core Curriculum All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; Religion, Theology & Culture courses; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for Social Justice; and Pathways. For all other Core requirements, it is possible for students to earn credit by taking Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, or by completing college-level courses prior to enrolling at Santa Clara. Transfer credit earned from courses completed before enrollment at Santa Clara is governed by two sets of rules: one for students admitted as first-year students and another for transfer students. Students admitted as first-year students must satisfy Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2, and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3 with courses completed at Santa Clara University. In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2, before their first quarter at Santa Clara. Information about possible substitutions for Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas courses is available in the Office of the Registrar. Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units and incomplete CTW or C&I sequences must take both courses in the Critical Thinking & Writing 1 & 2 sequence and/or in the Cultures & Ideas 1 & 2 sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, and have completed the first course in the sequence, will complete the sequence with an advanced course (either Cultures & Ideas 3 or Advanced Writing, depending on the sequence). Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in sequential order. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, must complete two courses from the Religion, Theology & Culture sequence in any order. Transfer students must declare their Pathways by the end of their third quarter at SCU. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units must take four courses (minimum of 16 units) toward the Pathways requirement. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) toward the Pathways requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) toward the Pathways requirement. All seniors write an integrative essay to complete their Pathway requirement. More detailed Pathway guidelines are available on the Pathways website. Transfer credit earned from courses completed after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill Core Curriculum requirements. Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 of this bulletin, as well as the chapter(s) relevant to their school or college.

The undergraduate residence halls at Santa Clara University are home to nine Residential Learning Communities (RLCs) established to foster integrated education within a community of scholars. By creating a culture in which students connect their academic experiences with their social and residential ones, the learning communities enhance the education of the whole person and deepen the connection between learning and living as responsible members of a community. All entering first-year students, whether or not they live on campus, become members of one of nine theme-based Residential Learning Communities. Nonresident first-year students are given access to the residence hall in which their learning community is located so that they can participate fully in its programs. In the theme-based learning communities, resident directors and faculty directors coordinate with spirituality facilitators and student staff to encourage high academic achievement, effective community living, and individual development. Students take at least one Core Foundations course in common with others in their learning community, enriching coursework and promoting the formation of study groups. Students also interact directly with faculty and staff and participate in theme-based co-curricular and extracurricular activities both on and off campus. Residential Learning Communities are primarily two-year communities, but some offer the opportunity for students to remain throughout their undergraduate careers. University residence halls accommodate more than half of the undergraduate population in coeducational communities with common lounge areas, study rooms, kitchen and laundry facilities, and other services. Most residence halls offer traditional double-occupancy rooms with common bath facilities; some halls offer suites and apartment-style accommodations with bathrooms en suite. All residence hall rooms and suites are equipped with cable television connections, Ethernet, and wireless network service.

Student-directed Honors programming builds community ties and fosters student leadership in the campus community and beyond. General Information The University Honors Program is the umbrella Honors Program for the entire University, providing Santa Clara's most academically accomplished students with intellectual opportunities based in small, seminar-style classes, especially in courses fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements. The UHP course of study combines broadly based, liberal learning with depth of specialization in a major field. UHP courses are designed to fit within the curricula of the humanities, natural and social sciences, business, and engineering. Possible majors include every undergraduate field in the University. With an average of 17 students each, seminars emphasize analytical rigor, effective expression, and interaction among professors and students. In the classroom and elsewhere on campus, UHP students enjoy a level of collaboration exceptional even at Santa Clara. Notable Features The University Honors Program features priority registration, housing in four of the nine RLCs, special lectures every quarter, a comprehensive yearlong senior thesis or project, and special fellowships and scholarships available only to Honors students. How and When to Apply Level I The Honors Program admits 68 first-year students each fall into what is called Level I. Entry at Level I is either by invitation to admitted first-year students who are Presidential Scholars, Provost Scholars, or Johnson Scholar semifinalists, or by application. Level I includes a curriculum of nine Honors-level courses plus a senior thesis. Students must submit applications for Level I by May 1 the year before entrance into the University. Level I application forms are available on the UHP website. Level II First-year students who have established a grade point average of 3.65 after completing 32 units of study at Santa Clara may apply for admission to Level II. Applicants will be evaluated for entry into Level II based on academic performance, recommendation letters from two SCU faculty members, a written essay, and an interview with the director. Five Honors-level courses, plus a thesis, are required for students admitted at this level. Students must submit applications for Level II by the end of week 4 in the spring quarter of their first year. Level II application forms are available on the UHP website. Students who transfer from another institution are encouraged to contact UHP as soon as they arrive on campus to be considered for admission to the program, based on their prior academic record. Qualifications for First-Year Admission Entering Honors Program students typically present a combined SAT in the upper 1400s or higher (ACT scores around 32 or higher), with a correspondingly high grade point average in college-prep courses.These considerations represent typical qualifications and do not guarantee admission to the program. The director may weigh other factors in determining a candidate's suitability for the limited number of places available each year. Acceptance recognizes high achievement in classes, standardized tests, service to school and community, leadership, and a desire for lifelong learning.

It is designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation, and analysis of public policies, and the operation of government, public, and nonprofit organizations. The program also provides an excellent foundation for students who want to pursue graduate studies in public policy or public administration and an alternative perspective for students who wish to pursue public law. Opportunities for Firsthand Study Through the Public Sector Studies Program in the Department of Political Science, students have the opportunity to participate in public sector internships, the Washington Semester Program, and the Panetta Institute Congressional Internship program. These programs offer preparation and training for students interested in working at the city, county, state, or federal level of government, in a public agency or nonprofit organization, or considering graduate-level studies in related fields. Internships Perhaps the best way to understand is by doing---students participating in public sector internships not only observe what happens in the \"real world,\" but they are able to take part as well, gaining invaluable experience and knowledge. Placements in public sector internships have included the San Jose mayor's and City Council members' offices, district offices of members of Congress and the California Legislature, government relations departments of high-tech corporations, public law offices including the Santa Clara county public defender and district attorney, political campaigns, and nonprofit organizations. Many students complete their internships with excellent employment prospects. The Washington Semester Program In the Washington Semester Program, students combine coursework taken at American University with hands-on experience via internships. In the past, SCU students have interned at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI, interest groups, broadcast news stations, various nonprofit organizations, and offices of members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Washington Semester Program offers students the opportunity to live, study, and work in our nation's capital for one semester along with students from other U.S. states and from countries abroad. Numerous programs of study are available, including American politics and U.S. foreign policy. Students participating in the Washington Semester Program earn up to 24 quarter credits for one semester of study. Grades and units received at American University will count toward the student's SCU grade point average and the course requirements for the department and the University, when appropriate. The Panetta Institute Congressional Internship Program The Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University, Monterey Bay, founded by Santa Clara political science alumnus Leon Panetta, offers an opportunity for students to gain an inside look at the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government and Washington, D.C., politics. This congressional internship begins with a two-week course at California State University, Monterey Bay, where students work directly with seasoned veterans examining the legislative process and its functions. The remaining two-and-a-half months of the internship are spent in Washington, D.C., working on Capitol Hill in the office of a member of the California congressional delegation. One exceptional Santa Clara University student is chosen each year for this fully subsidized internship. Eligibility To be eligible to participate in one of these public sector studies programs, students must have completed at least 88 quarter units of credit by the date that the program of study begins, must not be on academic or disciplinary probation, and must be in good financial standing with the University. Students must also meet grade point average and other eligibility requirements for the specific program.

Drahmann Academic Advising and Learning Resources Center coordinates academic support services for undergraduate students. University advisors in the Drahmann Center work closely with faculty and staff in the Residential Learning Communities, the academic deans' offices, the Cowell Center, the Career Center, the Office for Multicultural Learning, the Center for Student Involvement, and the Office of Student Life to ensure that academic advising and other academic support services are integrated for the benefit of students. Santa Clara University follows a developmental advising model based on a close student-faculty advisor relationship intended to assist students with achieving their educational, career, and personal goals through the use of the full range of institutional resources. The Drahmann Center offers training for faculty advisors through new faculty advisor workshops and ongoing training to keep faculty advisors current on University policies and available resources. The Center also collaborates with other areas to enhance advising support for all students, such as providing technology support for the peer advising program in the School of Business. The Drahmann Learning Resources Center offers drop-in group tutoring as well as individual tutoring appointments. Consultations and workshops on learning strategies, study skills, and time management provide students with additional support tailored to their specific needs. The Center also provides advising outreach for first-year and undeclared students and collaborates with the LEAD Scholars Program to ensure that first-generation college students are fully informed about the range of support services available to all students. Pre-Health Sciences Advising Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. Most incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medicine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more attractive, including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, public health professional, and others. A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by medical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the communication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school and in one's subsequent medical practice. Although Santa Clara does not have a premed major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in biochemistry, genetics, and human physiology, which are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The combination of Core Curriculum requirements with the University's focus on community involvement and issues of diversity will prepare students well for the MCAT 2015, with its greater emphasis on social, economic, and psychological determinants of health. Students should visit the Pre-Health Advising website and maintain regular contact with the pre-health sciences advisor throughout their undergraduate years for assistance with adjusting to college academic rigor and social life; developing an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; achieving balance between academics, social life, work, health community volunteering, and internships; selecting relevant entrance examinations; and applying to graduate health-science programs. Pre-Law Advising Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their undergraduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors. Consultation with a pre-law advisor familiarizes the student with the rigors of law school, the practice of law, the burden of law school debt, and the means to best secure employment as an attorney. Advisors will help formulate a program to prepare students for the complexity of the application process, including preparation for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Successful law school applicants come from a diversity of majors, such as anthropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biology, and economics. However, to successfully prepare for the LSAT, students are advised to select courses that deepen reading comprehension and promote logical reasoning. Law school admissions officers generally recommend undergraduate preparation by selecting a major that demands discipline, analytical ability, research skills, close reading of texts, creativity, verbal skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of philosophy and political science offer a pre-law emphasis within the major (in philosophy, it is also available within the minor). Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experience. Some elective courses strengthen specific abilities, while others provide perspective on legal issues and topics. Recommended electives are located on the website. Pre-Teaching Advising Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing to offer professional preparation for prospective elementary school, middle school, and senior high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades, both with a cross-cultural language and academic development emphasis. The teaching credential program at SCU is combined with a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Students interested in teaching should consider completing an interdisciplinary minor in urban education offered through the College of Arts and Sciences. The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area, who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to undergraduate studies and the credential/MAT program. The FTP is managed through the Child Studies Program. For more information, see Chapter 3, Child Studies Program.

We will also examine how individuals navigate the challenges of living in poverty, sometimes exerting their own agency despite having minimal access to resources. Over the course of the quarter, we will turn a critical eye towards discussions of the \"poverty problem\" or \"culture of poverty\". We will develop a more nuanced understanding of the conditions that create and reinforce these inequities, and how they give rise to biological feedback mechanisms that influence individual health outcomes. (5 units) 140. Food, Culture, and the Environment Exploration of the history and impact that food choices have made on human societies and the environment.

Barton, Samuel R. Hernandez Professors: Kathy Aoki, Kelly Detweiler, Kathleen Maxwell, Kate Morris Associate Professors: Blake de Maria (Harold and Edythe Toso Professor), Don Fritz, Takeshi Moro, Andrea Pappas (Department Chair), Ryan Reynolds Assistant Professors: Heather Clydesdale, Qiuwen Li Senior Lecturers: Renee Billingslea, Pancho Jiménez Lecturers: Ryan Carrington, Jessica Eastburn The Department of Art and Art History offers degree programs leading to the bachelor of arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both disciplines fostering a thorough understanding of the history and practice of art. Department faculty encourage interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara community through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of college and undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements, as well as offering courses through the University Honors Program. Art History Art history majors at Santa Clara examine the broad range of human visual expression across space and time, developing understandings of the meanings and purposes of the visual arts, including their historical development, roles in society, and relationships to other fields in the humanities. Students benefit from a program distinguished by excellent teaching and mentoring, challenging coursework, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, and student internships at local and Bay Area institutions. The art history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth that help students learn to think critically and communicate clearly about works of art. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in our annual Art History Symposium and the Art History Research Paper Competition. The art history major develops the following skills: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysis of visual objects and textual sources, advanced research and writing skills, and sophisticated oral presentations. The cultural understanding and intellectual skills developed through the program enable art history majors to pursue a variety of interests in a wide spectrum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history. Studio Art Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or careers in either the fine or commercial arts. Faculty members emphasize the development of conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student's own work and that of others. By graduation, every studio art major develops a body of original artwork to be exhibited in a senior show for display in the department gallery space. In conjunction with the senior show, students are required to articulate an artist's statement reflecting their own engagement with the creative process, in conjunction with their senior show. Studio art majors enjoy opportunities to present their artwork in regional conferences as well as in student-organized exhibitions on and off campus. At the end of each academic year, students are encouraged to submit their work to the Annual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professional in the field of art. The Department also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are awarded to outstanding studio art majors with junior standing.

Making China Modern On the long march from dynastic regime to global power, artmade China modern on its own terms. In the 19th century writers, politicians, and revolutionaries looked to Japan and Europe to learn how art could renovate the nation. After WWI, leftists weaponized woodcuts and folk arts to combat the forces of Japan and the U.S.-backed Nationalists. At the dawn of the People's Republic, art reorganized society and fueled radical conformity. As China globalized, artists cashed in on burgeoning markets, grappled with legacies, sounded alarms about oppression, and questioned \"The Chinese Dream.\" Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units) 30. The Built Environment The Built Environment examines the human factors responsible for shaping the spaces in which we live and work.

Fulfills the Studio Art Program modern or contemporary emphasis course requirement. (4 units) 66. Fabricating Nature in East Asia Across East Asia, artists and designers have fabricated landscapes to marshal natural forces for human-centered purposes. In China, visualizing Confucian and Daoist principles through paintings and gardens ordered society and cultivated individuals. In Korea, artists interpreted imported religions and philosophies through indigenous beliefs, giving birth to True View painting and seowon rural campuses. Japan's native Shintō steered Buddhism in new directions, culminating in Zen and roji tea gardens. Today, these religions, philosophies, aesthetics, and practices remain vigorous, exerting themselves in art and landscape design worldwide, offering solutions to environmental challenges, and alternatives to the isolation of modern life. Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units) 74. Basic Digital Imaging Hands-on introduction to computer imaging for the beginning level student.

Recommended as a foundation course to be taken prior to other computer art courses. (4 units) 81. Modern Indian Art This course will take you through a survey of modern Indian art in the 20th century. We will see how Indian artists constantly engaged with and responded to modernity and the modernisms they encountered in the global art world, while working through late-colonial, post-independence and contemporary Indian contexts. Early modern artists of the Bengal School of art grappled with the question of how to be \"modern\" and \"Indian\" in their search for an \"Indian-ness\" devoid of Western elements, while post-independence artists of the Progressive Artists Group could freely work with both Western modernism and Indian idioms toward self-expression. We will see how this trajectory moves into contemporary art and also contextualize feminism by reading about the works of women artists from varied backgrounds. Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units) 97. Special Topics Occasional courses in selected art historical topics. May be repeated for credit. (4 units) 98. Internship/Practicum Individual projects in conjunction with professional visual arts agencies. May be repeated for credit but no more than 4 units may count toward the major or minor.

Keeping up with the Medici: Fame and Family in Renaissance Florence What makes someone a \"household name\"? Is it talent, beauty, connections, or simply shrewd marketing? While fame, fortune, and celebrity may seem like modern phenomena, the cult of personality was equally prominent in Renaissance Florence. As is the case today, money played a key role in the arts. This course focuses on the ways in which the Medici family, through their social, financial, and spiritual support, transformed the city of Florence from an Italian commune with limited natural resources into the center of the European culture. And in doing so, transformed the notion of the artist from that of mere craftsman to superstar. Additional topics of discussion include the influence of the capitalist economics on artistic production, domestic art perceptions of the nude figure in religious paintings, the relationship between art and science, and the writings of Machiavelli. Cross-listed as HIST 125. (5 units) 121. Venice and the Other in the Renaissance Concentrates on the art and architecture of the Venetian Republic from approximately 1400--1650 CE, specifically the visual culture produced by and/or associated with ethnic and social groups excluded from the highest echelons of Venetian society. Areas of inquiry include Muslim merchants living in the city, construction of the Jewish ghetto, Ethiopian servant community, courtesan culture, convent life, the material culture of exorcism, witchcraft, and dwarfism. (5 units) 123. The Global Renaissance The \"Renaissance\" has traditionally been viewed as a period of artistic and cultural development associated almost exclusively with the Italian peninsula in the 15th and 16th century. This same tradition privileges \"high art\"---that is, painting, sculpture, and architecture over other forms of visual culture. This course seeks to reassess these notions by considering Italian Renaissance art within the context of early modern globalism. This reexamination likewise mandates a consideration of a broader spectrum of objects, including gemstones, glassware, and textiles. Topics such as the relationship between Michelangelo, Leonardo, and the Ottoman architect Sinan, the collection of Aztec feather paintings by the Medici family, and the influence of Egyptian mosque architecture on Venetian palace design will be examined from an interdisciplinary perspective.

McNelis, Amy M. Shachter, Grace Stokes, Steven W. Suljak Assistant Professors:Ian Carter-O'Connell, Benjamin Stokes Senior Lecturer: Steven L. Fedder The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers three baccalaureate degrees: the bachelor of science in chemistry, the bachelor of science in biochemistry, and the bachelor of arts in chemistry. The curriculum is accredited by the American Chemical Society (ACS), the professional organization for chemistry. The program prepares students for further work in chemistry or biochemistry, either in graduate school or as professional chemists. In addition, a chemistry or biochemistry degree is excellent preparation for careers in medicine, dentistry, law, engineering, business, and teaching. A minor in chemistry is also available. All bachelor of science degrees provide graduates with the background necessary to begin a career in chemistry or biochemistry at industrial and governmental laboratories, for admission to institutions offering graduate degrees in chemistry and biochemistry, and for admission to medical and dental schools as well as other professional programs in the health professions. The chemistry major provides equal training in all the disciplines in chemistry, and the biochemistry major combines training in chemistry with additional coursework in cell and molecular biology. The bachelor of science ACS-certified degrees meet all recommended standards for chemists and biochemists as mandated by the ACS. The bachelor of arts degree allows students the most freedom in choosing electives, and therefore is an excellent program for pre-medical or pre-teaching students. Students with a strong interest in the liberal arts or who wish to pursue subjects outside the standard science curriculum will benefit from this degree. The bachelor of arts degree can be effectively combined with a pre-law or business curriculum to provide excellent preparation for law or business careers in the technology sector. Undergraduate research is a critical component of our degrees and most of our majors conduct research in collaboration with faculty mentors. Research in the department has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, the Dreyfus Foundation, the Beckman Foundation, and Research Corporation for Science Advancement. Majors in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and public health science participate in faculty research projects through CHEM 182, 183, and 184. In addition, advanced students have opportunities for part-time employment assisting faculty in laboratory and related teaching activities. The chemistry and biochemistry curricula are designed to be flexible in the sequence of upper-division coursework so as to allow students to participate in study abroad programs. Students interested in study abroad should meet with a faculty advisor to plan the junior and senior year courses as early as possible in their academic careers.

Bachen, Justin Boren, Hsin-I Cheng, Rohit Chopra, Sreela Sarkar Assistant Professors: David Jeong, Marquette Jones, Nicole Opper, Chan Thai Senior Lecturers: Katharine Heintz, Barbara Kelley, Gordon Young Lecturers: Lisa Davis, Andrew W. Ishak, Emily Reese The Department of Communication offers a program of studies leading to a bachelor of arts in communication. The major prepares students for a wide variety of graduate studies and for careers in the communication industry. A minor in digital filmmaking or journalism is also available. Students explore the theories, research methods, responsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass communication, interpersonal communication, strategic communication, and computer-mediated communication. The major also integrates theory with practice. We help students to apply their knowledge of the communication process to create their own speeches, films, television programs, journalism, Web content, and communication and marketing campaigns. Many of our students go directly to work in these fields after graduation. Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students integrate courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often, students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related disciplines. To encourage students to explore global studies, the department accepts up to two approved study abroad courses toward completion of the communication course requirements, usually as upper-division electives. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus media organization or other communication-related institution. Internships may be counted for course credit as a department elective. In their senior years, all communication majors synthesize their learning in the department by completing a scholarly thesis (on any aspect of communication) or an applied capstone project (in journalism, digital filmmaking, or strategic communication/public relations). Theses and capstone projects, which typically embody students' most advanced work, are suitable for submission as part of applications for graduate school and jobs. Students interested in communication, including nonmajors, enjoy a wealth of co-curricular opportunities. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media, including the student newspaper, radio station, and yearbook. Practicum courses allow students to gain academic credit for working in student media. Santa Clara Debate, one of the oldest forensic programs in continuous operation on the West Coast, provides a challenging and rigorous co-curricular activity designed to develop public speaking skills, critical thinking, and public policy analysis. Policy debate participants are eligible to apply for merit scholarships. All courses taken to fulfill requirements for the major or minor must be four or five units and must be taken for a letter grade, not on a pass/no pass basis. Practicum courses, numbered 190 through 195, do not count toward fulfillment of the communication major or minor.

Global Media and Postcolonial Identity Paying careful attention to the meaning of the term \"postcolonial\" in different historical and geographical contexts, this course undertakes a critical analysis of media representations of national and cultural identity in postcolonial societies in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Evaluates the ways in which media constructions of national identity intersect with understandings of gender, race, religion, and ethnicity. A key focus area of the course is the experience of diasporic postcolonial communities as represented in media. Prerequisite: COMM 2. (5 units) 185A. Identity, Privacy, and Politics in the Digital Age This course examines the dynamics of communication in new media networks and forums, covering the overlapping categories of social networks, social media, blogs, microblogs, portals, and collective knowledge initiatives such as Wikipedia. We will analyze communication practices in new media with a focus on the following four areas: (1) convergence and links between forms of media and technology, such as mobile phones, computers, and books; (2) changing conceptions of self and community; (3) emerging of paradigms of creative collaboration and artistic and intellectual production; and (4) posed challenges about privacy, copyright, and intellectual ownership. We will examine these areas from a global perspective, keeping in mind both the global nature of new media networks and communities, and the particular trajectories of new media communicative practices in different global contexts. In this regard, we will also address the social, ethical, and political consequences of the \"digital divide\" between those who are networked and connected in this world and those who lack access to it. Prerequisite: COMM 2. (5 units) 186B. Global Interpersonal Communication This course explores ways to reflect on, connect, and communicate study abroad experiences.

Of particular interest is the development of film traditions such as neorealism, the French New Wave, Third Cinema, exilic/diasporic cinema, and other film movements that have emerged as an alternative to Hollywood's commercial cinema. Prerequisite: COMM 2 or consent of the instructor. (5 units) 188A. Special Topics in Film: Food and Ethnicity in Popular Culture This discussion-based course explores the production and reproduction of messages about race and nationality in popular media about preparing, eating, and sharing food. As we read critical race and communication studies texts and engage popular media, we will examine the ways that food narratives and images generate messages that reinforce or reimagine structures of inequality in the United States. Through written assignments and group discussion, we will learn to identify exclusionary media practices and build skills toward producing anti-racist, inclusive media. Prerequisite: none. (5 units) 189A. Communication, Identity, and Citizenship in Asia Citizenship is about membership. It includes processes of inclusions and exclusions. With abundant transnational business, treaties, and marriages, the selecting process is complicated by various local and global relations formed in the past to present. We will explore this process in the Asian region from historical, sociopolitical, cultural, and economic perspectives. We will wrestle with questions such as: Is citizenship an individual or collective matter? Is citizenship a universal concept? Is it useful? What does it mean to be a citizen in various Asian nations? You will work on a project on how citizenship is communicated in a nation state of your interest. Prerequisite: COMM 2 (5 units) 190.

This practical discipline provides insights into important issues such as, the determinants of wealth and poverty---unemployment, inflation, international trade, and economic growth; as well as success and failure in the marketplace. The rigorous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Economics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting. Students considering graduate study in economics leading to a master's or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appropriate course of study.

Lai, Anna Sampaio Associate Professors: Anthony Q. Hazard Jr., Sakina Hughes Assistant Professor: Jesica Fernández Senior Lecturer: Aparajita Nanda, (by courtesy) Department Chair Lecturer: Allia Griffin Ethnic studies is a compelling and dynamic discipline devoted to the critical examination of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and intersecting modes of inequality particularly as manifest in the experiences of historically marginalized populations. In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities while building on the critical studies of racialization and resistance with research and courses across a broad field including education, economic development, identity and empowerment, immigration, labor and employment, media, music, and popular culture, multiracial communities, sovereignty, transnational networks, voting rights, and political representation. Ethnic studies focuses on the roles and experiences of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations with particular attention paid to African Americans/Blacks, American Indian/Indigenous/Native Americans, Asian Pacific Islander, and South Asian Americans, Chicanas/os/xs and Latinas/os/xs and Middle Eastern and North Africans within the framework of the United States and within transnational networks. Coursework also emphasizes the comparative interaction between various racial/ethnic groups and cross-national approaches to their histories, cultural productions, and socioeconomic and political experiences. As an academic department, Ethnic Studies fosters intersectional and interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of experts in critical racial and ethnic studies, while serving as teachers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. The Ethnic Studies Department strives to make connections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change, and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashioning a more equitable, humane, and just world. The Ethnic Studies Department serves as a resource for students, faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in examining race and ethnicity and its intersections with multiple modes of inequality including class, gender, citizenship, and nationality. The department offers students the option to complete a major in ethnic studies (Bachelor of Science) or a minor in ethnic studies, African American studies, Asian American Studies, or Latina/o/x Studies. The major provides students with advanced and concentrated training in racial and ethnic studies with coursework clustered in the upper division around six themes: Community Engagement and Social Movements; Race, Law, Politics, and Policy; Intersectionality and Hybridity; Inequality and Education; Immigration, Transnationalism, and Globalization; and Social and Cultural Analysis. Both the stand alone major and three minors enhance a student's employment opportunities in business, community service work, education, law, medicine, social work, politics, and government and do important work in establishing a foundation for students to pursue racial and ethnic justice after graduation.. For those considering graduate school, the majors provide a foundation for graduate studies particularly for those who seek to become university professors and researchers with a specialization in a variety of issues and policies impacting racial and ethnic communities.

Race, Class, and Culture through Film Explores how filmmakers who are concerned about racism portray the politics, history, and culture of people of African descent. Examines how this medium can humanize subjects who are often objectified and exploited and give voice to communities whose perspectives and opinions have been historically excluded from mainstream discourses. Considers how films can interrogate the physical, cultural, and sometimes, psychological brutality of racist practices, as well as the ways that racism intersects with other forms of marginalization related to class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship.

How did the civil rights struggle gain momentum in the aftermath of World War II? What was the longer history and role of \"black nationalism\" and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? What were the connections between the civil rights movement and contemporary independence movements in Africa and Asia? One of the central goals of the course is to show how we can expand our understanding of U.S. history by reaching beyond the interaction between the U.S. government and other nation-states to examine political and cultural change.

As Black Power activists sought to fight racism and achieve liberation by asserting Black political, cultural, and economic autonomy, the course therefore centers critiques of capitalism, political organizing, community empowerment, and artistic expression as articulated and practiced by Black Power activists throughout the 20th century. (5 Units) 178. Race and World War II World War II stands as one of the most explosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the postwar world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of \"race\" in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178. (5 units) 180. Race, Voting, Campaigns, and Elections This class examines how the traditional vehicles of American political participation -- namely voting, campaigns, and elections -- have been racialized throughout American history and the particular impacts and responses among African Americans and Latinas/os/xs. As part of this examination we look closely at the participation of racial and ethnic minorities in various forms of electoral activity (as both voters and candidates), we analyze enduring obstacles to their political empowerment (both structural and resource constraints), and highlight efforts to remove those barriers. A critical examination of the upcoming national elections will feature prominently throughout this course and students will have the opportunity to examine local elections more closely through an original research project designed to study the intersection of race and voting in San Jose, California. (5 units) 184. Seminar - Women of Color in the United States Explores the historical and present-day issues for women of color in the United States inclusive but not limited to key topics such as sexuality, family, work, media, and activism. Students will examine the impact of racism, sexism, heterosexism, and classism on African American, Asian American, Chicana/x and Latina/x, and American Indian/Indigenous/Native American women in the United States. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students will also investigate their shared experiences as well as their differences. (5 units) 185. Seminar in U.S.Racial and Ethnic Politics Selected topics in U.S. politics. Also listed as POLI 195DW. This course has Diversity and Advanced Writing components. Prerequisites: POLI 153; CTW 1&2 for the Advanced Writing component. (5 units) 186. Seminar - Contemporary Latina/o/x Immigration Issues This class creates a seminar version of ETHN 120 Mexican Immigration to the U.S. (see description above) by covering the same topics but focusing outcomes on producing original student research (either paper or project) and highlighting student participation and presentations through weekly readings and other course material. (5 units) 187. Seminar - Youth Activism & Contemporary Social Movements Youth Activism & Contemporary Social Movements examines current social movements catalyzed and led by young people. The course specifically examines youth community organizing and youth activism as a context for social justice work that parallels, yet differs from the Civil Rights Movements of the 1960s. In this course, we engage an intersectional analysis of race, age, and other markers of identity and difference. Through this perspective we will examine the contributions and role of young people in contemporary 21st-century social movements from the 1960s through the present that have contributed to contemporary youth activisms. Within a U.S. context, social movements have often been grouped into three different time periods: the Civil Rights Movement, the post-1960s, and the contemporary social movements. The thematic organization of these periods reflects the different struggles experienced by social groups within societies, and the varied approaches and mechanisms through which communities and young people organized. Although these social movements and waves of political activism are characterized and shaped by the timeframe of their unique sociopolitical context, there are similarities across all periods. One similarity across these times frames concerns the significant leadership and activism of young people---children, youth, and young adults---to resist and challenge structures of power and systems of oppression. From Anti-Islamophobia movements; to Black Lives Matter; to Undocumented & Unafraid; to LGBTQ and women's rights movements; to the institutionalization of ethnic studies curricula and the ending of gun violence in schools---all of these movements underscore the power of young people. (5 units) 188. Seminar - Civil Rights and Anti-Colonial Movements This course examines the connections between two historical developments often treated separately: the U.S. civil rights struggle and anti-colonial movements across the globe. By placing these movements in a transnational framework, we will explore through readings and the production of an original research paper, the global challenge to the racialized world order of the modern world. What was the longer history and role of Black Nationalism and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? How did women contribute to the longer struggle against white supremacy in both the United States and colonial world? The central goal of the course is to expand our understanding of anti-racist struggle by moving beyond the formal boundaries of the United States of America in the 20th and 21st centuries. (5 units) 194. Peer Educator in Ethnic Studies Peer educators in ethnic studies work closely with a faculty member to help students in an ethnic studies course understand course material, think more deeply about course material, benefit from collaborative learning, and/or to help students enjoy learning. Enrollment is by permission of the instructor. (2 units) 195. Advanced Seminar in Critical Race Theory and Methods This course serves as an introduction to several of the methods used in advanced research in critical race and ethnic interdisciplinary research. The course will examine a range of theoretical and applied topics in research methods including: debates in epistemology, objectivity, interdisciplinary, and intersectionality; how to formulate a research design (from research question to presentation of findings); and applications of specific methodological tools such as interviews, participant observation, biography, content analysis, experimental design, and survey research. This course is exclusively for ethnic studies majors and minors. (5 units) 196. Praxis and Practitioners of Critical Racial and Ethnic Studies This class is organized around a weekly presentation, lecture, film, or other engagement by a local, regional, or national practitioner or activist whose work addresses key challenges and social justice work within racial and ethnic minority communities. The weekly presentation will serve as a focal point for critical analysis of contemporary racial and ethnic studies including pressing social, cultural, economic, and political issues within historically marginalized racial minority communities. Students are required to attend the weekly presentation and write a short reflect that summarizes their individual experiences. Prerequisite: Any Ethnic Studies course . (2 units) 197.

Historical Writing Researching and writing history papers. Required of all majors. For history majors and minors; majors will be given priority. Recommended to be taken in the sophomore or junior year. (5 units) Lower-Division Course: Global History 21. Human Rights and Humanitarianism From reading current news articles, one might surmise that the dignity of human beings and their inherent right of freedom from undue suffering are self-evident, universally acknowledged goods that we should all pursue regardless of culture, place, or time. In fact, however, contemporary ideas about human rights, as well as humanitarian efforts, (often pursued in far distant locales) have a particular history, one rooted in Western Enlightenment-era ideals of individual liberty and the brutal experiences of European imperialism. In this class, we will examine the histories and ideologies of human rights and humanitarianism; consider their underlying assumptions and power dynamics; and investigate the ways these histories relate to current legal, political, and humanitarian organizations and movements. (4 units) 43. The Haitian Revolution in World History and Memory Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the \"age of democratic revolutions.\" This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island. This course will examine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, its near erasure from Western historical memory, and the literary and historical recovery of its importance in the 20th and 21st centuries. (4 units) 68. Global 1968 History is not only an account of what happened, but also why things change. This class will focus on the political, cultural and social events of 1968, both within and without the United States, and the legacies and ramifications for twenty-first century political culture. A better comprehension of where we are at present comes from an understanding of the past. In addition to gaining some knowledge of history, the aim of this course is to help students improve their interpretive analyses and critical thinking skills through reading, writing, and class discussions. (4 units) 79. Technology: Steam to Cyborgs This course provides an overview of important technological advances since the Industrial Revolution and takes a close look at a few specific technological touchstones from the 1760s to the 1920s. The rise of machines during this period profoundly influenced and challenged what it means to be human. A key goal is to question and explore the social and cultural context of emerging technologies and use the past as a guide for preparing ourselves in our own time of rapid change. Topics include the factory system, steam engines, photography, sound recording, cinema, industrial automation and design, and artificial intelligence. (4 units) 93. Cold War This course concentrates on the origins and consequences of the Cold War from a global perspective. The course covers the period from 1945 until 1991, considering economic, political, and social implications of the ideological conflict of communism versus capitalism. The course explores the origins of the conflict, the formation of opposing blocs, the interplay between periods of tension and détente, the engagement with contemporary anti-colonialism movements, and the relationship between the center of the conflict in the North Atlantic/European arena and its global periphery, the demise of the Soviet Union, and the enduring legacies of the Cold War. (4 units) Upper-Division Courses: Global History 102S. Genocide and Gender in the 20th Century This course explores the gendered dimensions of genocide, focusing largely but not only on the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, the Holocaust during World War II, the Bosnian genocide in the 1990s after the collapse of communism in the former Yugoslavia, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Also listed as WGST 108. (5 units) 104. World History Until 1492 An overview of the great civilizations of the world prior to the Columbian Exchange, focusing on the geographical, cultural, economic, and political features of the complex societies in East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania. Survey of the foundations of each region. Patterns of connection and interdependence in world history. (5 units) 116. Sex and Gender in the Age of High Imperialism An examination of the role of sexuality and gender in the global expansion of European hegemony in the 19th and 20th centuries. Explores these themes through literature, historical scholarship, and film. Also listed as WGST 124. (5 units) 121. Human Rights and Humanitarianism From reading current news articles, one might surmise that the dignity of human beings and their inherent right freedom from undue suffering are self-evident, universally acknowledged goods that we should all pursue regardless of culture, place, or time. In fact, however, contemporary ideas about human rights, as well as humanitarian efforts (often pursued in far distant locales), have a particular history, one rooted in Western Enlightenment-era ideals of individual liberty and the brutal experiences of European imperialism. In this class, we will examine the histories and ideologies of human rights and humanitarianism, consider their underlying assumptions and power dynamics, and investigate the ways these histories relate to current legal, political, and humanitarian organizations and movements. (5 units) 123. History of Plagues, Epidemics, and Infections An exploration of scientific, social, cultural, political, and ethical contexts in the history of infectious diseases and epidemics. Particular attention is given to how the social framing of epidemiological thought has shaped responses by societies, how public health is an intrinsically political matter, and how we can envision the place played by social justice perspectives in fashioning global public health. (5 units) 124. History of Sexually Transmitted Diseases This course will survey the impact of sexually transmitted infections in a variety of national contexts, from the early modern period to recent times. The focus is mainly upon the history of classic venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea as well as more recently HIV/AIDS. How have medical debates about sexual contagion both influenced and been influenced by cultural conventions of blame, stigma, and moral judgment? Do representations of STDs provide a window into how a society organizes gendered expectations and constructs an image of deviant sexuality? How have responses to the problem of STDs changed over time? Can we examine these changes to better understand broader cultural adjustments to issues as diverse as prostitution and promiscuity, medical treatment and prophylaxis, and the politics of feminism, gay rights, and patients rights. (5 units) 138S. Gender and Rights in the Modern Era This seminar examines gender and rights in the contexts of citizenship, marriage and divorce, reproduction, health, the workplace, the body, and other categories of analysis with cases taken from modern Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Oceania. Also listed as WGST 127. ( 5 units) 143.

(5 units) Lower-Division Courses: United States History 27. Digital and Public History This course is an introduction to the intersection of digital history and public history. The course will explore digital literacy, with a focus on public history. Students will discuss how public history differs from academic history and how public history presents its material. Students will consider how digital history provides a unique outlet for public history. Students will explore how history is preserved online both in primary and secondary sources. Students will learn about the continuity and sustainability of digital history, including a lifelong commitment to both preservation and creation of history. Students will also explore how historians access sources created digitally, which has rapidly changed in just a few decades meaning some sources are inaccessible without old technology. In this course, students will interact and use a variety of digital tools and resources. Students will learn how these technologies have changed and have the opportunity to use some of the technologies to present their own research on a topic of their choosing. Also listed as History 127. (4 units) 60. Immigration & Race in the U.S. Since its founding immigration has been one of the most celebrated characteristics of the United States, but it is also one of the most contested. This course will look at the history of immigration to the territory that makes up the United States from the late 18th century to the present day. We will examine immigration policies and practices, integration and exclusion, race and citizenship, and anti-immigrant movements. We will examine the forces driving immigration and the experiences of individuals and communities, as well as the reception of immigrants based on social categories like race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and religion. As such, we will cover salient issues in immigration discourse over the last century including xenophobia, exclusion laws, deportation policy, and border policing - all of which are pertinent to immigration policy today. This class will ground students in the history of immigration in the United States, but will also provide opportunities to reflect on current debates. (4 units) 65. United States Political History: Democracy and Elections An exploration of U.S. politics from the creation of the American republic to the present. Themes studied will include the rise and demise of political party systems, clashes between rival interest groups, and the evolving relationship between Americans and their government.

It focuses on key social, economic, and political developments during the period and on cross-cultural interactions between (and among) Euro-American colonists, Native peoples, and peoples of African descent. While the course examines the settler colonies that subsequently became the United States, it also emphasizes the development of the rival French and Spanish empires in North America as well as the rise of pan-Native movements aimed at resisting colonial domination. This course strives to investigate North America's colonial past by considering a wide range of perspectives, reflecting the diversity of the various peoples who shaped its development. (4 units) 83. American Historical Geography America's geography is not just the stage for American History but an integral player in that history. This course explores how Americans' interactions with the continent's physical geography and built environments have shaped the nation from the pre-colonial era through the present day. Topics covered include: land use by Native peoples and settlers; U.S. expansion; immigration and internal migrations; urbanization, suburbanization, and gentrification; the conservation, preservation and environmental movements; and the response to natural and human-instigated disasters. Special emphasis is placed on topics related to California, and on the experiences of people marginalized by race, class and gender. (4 units) 84.

African-American Pursuit of Freedom The course covers various strategies African Americans used to attain freedom. These include slave rebellions, moral suasion for the Abolitionist movement, pamphleteering and political tracts by Black intellectuals and their impact on contemporaneous political discourse. Conversely, it engages with important judicial, executive, and legislative decisions that affected the African American struggle for freedom, equality, and manhood/womanhood in the 19th century. It will therefore give particular attention to film and written documentaries on rebellions like the Nat Turner rebellion, cases such as The Missouri Compromise (1820), and laws like The Fugitive Slave Law (1850), It will also examine cases like Dred and Harriet Scott (1857), and proclamations like the Emancipation Proclamation/13th Amendment (1863--1865). Also listed as ETHN 137. (5 units) 156. African-American History The diversity of the African-American experience---freedom and justice, community and identity, ethnicity and class---continuing through the crusade for political and civil rights, and the impact of gender within the black community, and struggle into the present century.

Turmoil and Reform: United States 1877--1920 This informal lecture/discussion course examines the rich history of the evolving social, economic, political, and intellectual life of Americans from the end of Reconstruction through the peace following World War I. This course traces the dramatic changes that took place as the United States transformed into an urban industrial giant. This course also examines tensions between poverty and wealth, and the nation's struggles over immigrants, gender, race, and America's rightful role in global politics. (5 units) 160. America's Immigrants This course will look at the history of immigration to the territory that makes up the United States of America. From the 18th century to events in the modern United States, we will explore the forces driving immigration and the process of acculturation in the United States. Varied case studies provide a starting point to better understand forced migration from Africa, 18th- and 19th-century immigration from Europe, migrant communities from Asia, and 20th- and 21st-century migrations from the Americas into the United States. Beyond understanding the factors driving immigration and the experiences of immigrant communities, this course explores the reception of migrants based on the influence of categories like race, gender, and religion. This class will ground you in the history and politics of immigration within the United States, but also will provide opportunities to reflect on the current debates around immigration, refugees, and other relevant contemporary issues. (5 units) 165. United States Political History: Democracy and Elections An exploration of U.S. politics from the creation of the American republic to the present. Themes studied will include the rise and demise of political party systems, clashes between rival interest groups, and the evolving relationship between Americans and their government.

(5 units) 168. Malcolm and Martin This course explores the lives, philosophies, and political activism of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. In an effort to complicate the violence/nonviolence paradigm, which has often pitted the two men as political opponents, this course seeks to uncover the long trajectory of the philosophical development and political activism of both men through the end of each of their lives, in 1965 and 1968 respectively. Both figures' lives and activism are situated within the black freedom movement of the 20th century, which was both transnational and global. As such, this course attempts to locate these two figures within various iterations of black nationalism, civil rights activism, anti-colonialism, and Black Power. Also listed as ETHN 133.

(5 units) 172A. American Slavery/Emancipation An investigation of slavery and the slave trade in North America, focusing especially on the United States and its colonial antecedents. We will consider the ways in which Euro-American colonization and the American and Haitian revolutions influenced ideas about race and slavery. We will also examine challenges to slavery, including various forms of resistance by the enslaved, as well as the anti-slavery and abolitionist movements that undermined the institution and contributed to its demise. The course will emphasize the lived experiences of the enslaved and of freed people in the wake of emancipation, as well as slavery's lingering role in shaping ideas about race. Finally, we will consider more recent depictions of slavery intended for broader audiences, such as literature and film, in order to discuss the place of slavery in public consciousness and historical memory.

(5 units) 131. Britain and the First World War World War I gave birth to a range of difficult questions regarding the relationship between democratic ideals and how societies organize for modern conflicts, setting a strong pattern for the 20th century and continuing to possess strong resonances for today. What strains and opportunities does war place upon democratic societies? Does modern patriotism enable or distort the aspirations of free societies? What forces propel individuals to assist or resist modern war making? This course encourages students to think of war as not an activity solely directed by generals and politicians, but rather a social and cultural event that is formed and negotiated by citizens, workers, and parents. This course places the World War I battlefront in the context of British imperial history, and especially examines how four years of fighting shaped Britain's modern national and civic identity. Readings and materials cover the significance of the home front in many forms including the propaganda machine, the Irish problem, public school tradition, industrial organization and trade union activity, and the women's vote campaign.

ISP majors can lead to a bachelor of arts (B.A.) degree or a bachelor of science (B.S.) degree in social science. ISP does not offer a bachelor of science (natural science) degree option. Courses for the ISP major must be chosen from a significant number of different disciplines. Such curricular diversity for ISP proposals is considered essential and defining of any ISP major. There is a strong preference for curriculum for the proposed ISP major to be constituted from existing courses, as opposed to independent study or directed readings courses. Study abroad courses can play an important role in an ISP major but are subject to limits. Courses taken abroad may be used to complete no more than four courses in the proposed plan of study. The student must identify and secure a faculty advisor who agrees to oversee the ISP major. All continuing SCU faculty members in good standing may serve as the academic advisor for an ISP major. The faculty member's area(s) or expertise must intersect with the student's proposed area of study. The faculty member is responsible for reviewing and approving the coursework (including possible electives and, if necessary, substitutions) and for providing the ISP student with at minimum annual advising during the spring quarter. The faculty advisor also agrees to complete the student's pre-graduation audit associated with the ISP major requirements. Requirements for the Major In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts or bachelor of science (social science) degrees within the College of Arts and Sciences, students majoring in ISP must complete the following programmatic requirements: Be a full-time student at Santa Clara for at least one year Have fewer than 111 quarter units of academic work completed at the time of application Have a minimum 3.0 grade point average Submit a Petition for Admission to the ISP director for review and approval. The petition should include: A clear, logical, and conceptually refined description of the proposed program A well developed argument, supported by appropriate evidence, showing that no existing academic major can meet the student's educational objectives A plan of study listing courses, seminars, internships, etc., that meets the student's educational objectives and fulfills the requirements of the undergraduate Core Curriculum An academic advisor whose expertise is associated with the proposed area of study and who has agreed to serve as the student's academic advisor for the ISP major Students who want to pursue an ISP major should begin by scheduling a meeting with the program director to obtain a list of instructions regarding administrative details.

Radunskaya, Pomona College The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science offers major programs leading to the bachelor of science in mathematics or the bachelor of science in computer science, as well as required and elective courses for students majoring in other fields. Either major may be pursued with any of three principal goals: preparation for graduate studies leading to advanced degrees in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, operations research, or other fields; preparation for secondary school teaching of mathematics or computer science; or preparation for a research career in business, industry, or government. The major in mathematics may be taken with an emphasis in applied mathematics, data science, financial mathematics, mathematical economics, or mathematics education. The emphasis in mathematics education is designed to prepare majors to take the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET). The major in computer science offers emphases specializing in algorithms and complexity, data science, security, software, or one of the student's choosing. Minors in mathematics or computer science are also available. The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science maintains a program for the discovery, encouragement, and development of talent in mathematics or computer science among undergraduates. This program includes special sections, seminars, individual conferences, and directed study guided by selected faculty members. Students are also encouraged to participate actively in research projects directed by faculty. Requirements for the Major In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students majoring in mathematics or computer science must complete the following departmental requirements for the respective degree: Major in Mathematics CSCI 10 (or demonstrated equivalent proficiency in computer programming) MATH 11, 12, 13, 14, 23, 51, 52, and 53 PHYS 31 and 32. Students with a special interest in the application of mathematics in the social sciences or economics may substitute ECON 170 or 173 for PHYS 32. Students planning to teach in secondary schools may substitute, with approval of the department chair, PHYS 11 and 12 for PHYS 31 and 32. Seven approved 5-unit upper-division courses in mathematics or computer science, which must include at least one course in analysis (MATH 102, 105, or 153), at least one course in algebra (MATH 103 or 111), and at least one course selected from geometry (MATH 101, 113, or 174), or from discrete mathematics (MATH 176 or 177), or from applied mathematics (MATH 122, 125, 141, 144, 146, 155, or 166). MATH 100, 192, 195, and CSCI 192 do not count toward the seven courses. It is not required to select an emphasis for the major in mathematics.

Our faculty of professional language educators and scholars integrates the teaching of language and culture throughout our curricula in order to enable students to communicate effectively across cultures; to appreciate cultural diversity; to interpret and discuss words, images, texts, and discourses in their sociocultural context; and to identify and analyze problems across cultural and national boundaries. With rigorous, high-quality programs deeply rooted in our Jesuit values and in the principles of the liberal arts experience, we offer students unique learning experiences, both in and out of the classroom, which enrich their personal lives, help them discern a future career path, and prepare them to compete locally and globally for a wide variety of careers. The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as degree programs leading to the Bachelor of Arts in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, and Spanish studies. Honors programs are available for French majors. The department offers minors in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, Japanese studies, and Spanish studies. Students can also combine language studies, especially Arabic, Chinese, or German with interdisciplinary minors (e.g., Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern studies; Asian studies; international studies; international business) or an individual studies major, which is offered by the College of Arts & Sciences.

Technology, Science and Society: From Romanticism to the Digital Age When we think of technology today, we tend to think of smartphones, social media and the Internet. Technology has come to be identified with what is only a particular kind (i.e., information technology), but the concept itself is far broader. Accordingly, this class seeks to study the formative influences and social impacts of technology and techno-culture. Its starting point will be the utopian science of nineteenth-century Paris, which saw the rise of photography, daguerreotypes, automata, panoramas and electrodynamics, amongst other interesting experiments. Such \"romantic\" technologies were described in terms of spiritual quest and self-expression, often in ways which anticipate contemporary obsessions with social media and technological progress. In order to explore both romantic and present-day understandings of technology and its social implications, we will establish a dialogue between nineteenth-century techno-culture and our current digital age.

The Revolution in Mexican Culture The Mexican Revolution (1910-1940) was a foundational event in that nation's history. Both a political and social revolution, it sought to fundamentally reshape the Mexican social order through land and education reform, the protection of workers' rights, the nationalization of resources, and the championing of peasant and indigenous communities. Though the Constitution of 1917, one of its most important legacies, was one of the first national documents in the world to enshrine both political and socio-economic rights, the Revolution only partially achieved its lofty goals.

Narconarrativa By most estimates, the wave of violence that has assailed Mexico since then-president Felipe Calderón launched the war on drug trafficking in 2006 has claimed nearly 200,000 lives. This seemingly pervasive brutality has precipitated its aesthetic representation across a wide range of genres and discourses, including journalism, literature, music, and the visual arts. Principal among these cultural productions is a subgenre of crime novel known as the narconovela. In this course we will examine how narconarrativa presents the drug trade between the U.S. and Mexico and analyze its literary and cinematic representations, considering both their limitations and function as social critique. Course prerequisite is SPAN 101, or equivalent. (5 units) 143. Detective Short Story Detective fiction is considered by many as mere escapist entertainment. However, as we will discover in this course, it can contain a subtle yet mordant denunciation of social injustice. This is especially true in societal conditions that preclude an open discussion of institutional abuses, as was the case in the dictatorial and post-dictatorial states of Ibero-America in the second-half of the 20th century. In more recent decades, the detective story can be read as a commentary on the social inequality that characterizes modern society. In this class we will read a selection of short stories from various sub-genres of detective fiction and analyze how each of these texts serves as social critique. Prerequisite: SPAN 101 or equivalent. (5 units) 146.

Representations of the Migrant Condition in Contemporary Spain In this course we will explore themes related to exile, immigration, racism, gender, identity, nationalism, and citizenship in 20th- and 21st-century Spain. We will analyze a variety of cultural productions (short story, testimony, novel, film, and critical texts) created about and by migrants. In these texts, we will consider guiding questions that include: Who are \"we\" and who are \"others\"? What identities are typically cast as normative and which as marginal? What dichotomies become manifest in the narrative or filmic expressions of those identities that comprise present-day Spain? Do bicultural identities exist in contemporary Spain? Prerequisite: SPAN 101 or equivalent. (5 units) 165.

Barber Jr., Christopher P. Weber, Betty A. Young (Department Chair and Lee and Seymour Graff Professor II) Associate Professors: John T. Birmingham, Philip R. Kesten, Guy Ramon Assistant Professor: Bachana Lomsadze Lecturers: Kristin Kulas, Nathan Williams Senior Lab Instructors: Omid Ahmadi-Gorgi, Roxana Flacau The Department of Physics offers major programs of lecture and laboratory instruction leading to the bachelor of science in physics, the bachelor of science in physics with a biophysics emphasis, and the bachelor of science in engineering physics. The department also provides an academic minor in physics and required and elective courses for students majoring in other fields. Common career goals of physics majors include professional employment in industry, in a government lab, or at a university. It is not uncommon for physics majors to become entrepreneurs, work in the business or finance sector, or teach at the secondary school level. The undergraduate major program in physics is appropriate preparation for graduate study in physics, astronomy and astrophysics, biophysics, environmental science, geological science and geophysics, medical physics and medicine, patent law, oceanography, and other fields. Popular second majors, or minors for physics majors, include mathematics, computer science, chemistry or areas of engineering .The SCU physics major is offered in two forms. Students can choose between a traditional \"physics track\" or a \"biophysics track\". Both tracks provide a solid preparation for graduate studies and for nearly all of the postgraduate opportunities open to traditional physics majors. Students who complete the biophysics track will have additional opportunities in medicine, the life sciences, and related industries. The engineering physics major is particularly appropriate for the applied science student who intends to do research and development work in industry, or attend graduate school in physics, applied physics, materials science or various engineering disciplines. The engineering physics major covers a broad spectrum of courses in mathematics, engineering, and physics. This program emphasizes, to a greater extent than the traditional engineering major, the physics fundamentals that are applicable to new technologies as well as to the more established ones. Research in the department is currently funded by the Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, NASA and private industry. Majors in physics and engineering physics often participate in faculty research projects through PHYS 198 (Undergraduate Physics Research) or external grants, internships or fellowships, including Geoff and Josie Fox Summer Research Fellowships. Students also have opportunities for part-time employment assisting faculty in laboratory and related teaching activities. A student whose GPA is below a 2.5 must obtain approval from the department chair to declare a Physics or Engineering Physics major. Requirements for the Major The department offers two versions of the physics major (a \"physics track\" and a \"biophysics track\"), as well as a separate major in engineering physics.

Emphasis in Pre-Law Political science is one of the most common majors for pre-law students. After all, political science is the closest of all majors to the institutions and values with which law deals. The primary study of law is the state, and so too for political science. Additionally, the demands of political science courses (reading of complex texts, independent research, frequent class presentations, and demanding writing assignments) strengthen the analytical and communications skills that the practice of law requires. Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include a variety of courses from both inside and outside of the political science department. At most, six courses are required: three within the political science department and three from outside the political science department, although many of these courses fulfill other Core and political science major requirements.

Requirements for the Major In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in religious studies must complete the following departmental requirements: Three lower-division courses, one from each of the three areas (scripture and tradition; theology, ethics, and spirituality; and religion and society) Seven approved upper-division courses, including three designated religious studies seminars, with one in each of the three areas RELS 90 (Theories and Methods) RELS 197A and RELS 197B, a two quarter capstone seminar Requirements for the Minor Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in religious studies: One introductory-level religious studies course (1--19) Two intermediate-level courses (20--99) Four approved advanced-level courses (100--199), one of which must be a religious studies seminar. Of the seven courses, at least one must be from each of the three areas (scripture and tradition; theology, ethics, and spirituality; and religion and society). Lower-Division Courses: Scripture and Tradition (SCTR) 15. Texting God This course explores how people express their beliefs and how the technologies they use shape what they say. Focusing on Jewish and Christian \"texts\" (oral, written, visual, gesture), we'll examine the core beliefs that communities inscribe in them. We'll also consider how scriptural memes are reconstructed in the ongoing process of building cultural memory. We'll learn to analyze the rhetoric of various modes, and ask how changing technologies are altering our experience of text, scripture, and our relationships with God. (4 units) 19. Religions of the Book This course offers an introduction to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam with a study of their central texts, traditions and practices. We begin the course with a paradox: religion, that which in its literal sense \"binds\" or \"fastens together,\" is also that which often violently divides our world. As we examine the sacred texts of Jews, Christians, and Muslims (Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran), and various methods of interpreting them, our focus will remain on what is shared and what characteristically distinguishes between the monotheistic faiths. (4 units) 26. Gender in Early Christianity The history of early Christianity is often portrayed as a history of, by, and about men, despite clear indications that women played a prominent role in the early church. Introduces the construction of gender in antiquity, Jewish and Greco-Roman laws and customs, the biblical canon, and other Christian texts. Contemporary feminist perspectives will inform the discussion. Also listed as WGST 46. (4 units) 27. Digging Up Jesus This course examines the archaeological and literary evidence for Jesus. We'll use these primary \"texts\" to reconstruct the most plausible context for Jesus' work so that we can better understand the Gospel message, and learn the criteria for assessing whether he really said and did what the Gospels report. We'll also try to appreciate what the Gospel authors were doing in translating Jesus for their communities, just as we are doing ourselves with the historical approach of the course. (4 units) 28. Women In the Hebrew Bible This course explores stores, tropes, metaphors, poetry, and archaeology related to Hebrew Bible and Old Testament (HB/OT) women. Biblical studies methodologies and interdisciplinary lenses will be used to create access points with the material culture of the Ancient Near East (ANE), literary life and afterlives of biblical texts, as well as intersectional juxtapositions between ANE and contemporary lives of women. We will explore questions such as: Did God have a wife? Are the oldest parts of the HB/OT written by women? How many different ways can families be defined? How does the HB/OT promote leadership and women? Also listed as WGST 21. (4 units) 39. Biblical Women and Power Hero, villain, prophet, deviant---these are some of the power roles embodied by women in the Bible. Explores the exercise of power by biblical women in actual and figurative situations, in culturally positive and negative ways. Attention will be given to the continuing impact of such traditions for gender socialization in our world today. Also listed as WGST 47. (4 units) 48. Racializing Jesus The course explores the various ancient and contemporary ethnic representations of Jesus in art, film, regalia, and scripture. Although portraits of Jesus as a white, blue-eyed prophet, messiah, or rabbi haunt the popular cultural imagination, these often reflect the social location and racial biases of Western scholars. But, what if Jesus was black, non-white Latinx, Amerindian, Asian, or Jewish? And, why is contemporary scholarship still grappling with the idea of Jewish messiah? In order to map the politics of interpretation and presentation, the course seeks to \"radicalize\" Jesus by (1) exploring his Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (2) critically engaging sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; (3) interrogation of the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship; and (4) mapping the implications for marginalized ethnic communities and interracial dialogue. Key themes to explore include: race/ethnicity, colonialism and imperialism, the quests for historical Jesus, Hitler's Third Reich, eugenics, interreligious dialogue, police violence (Ferguson & Baltimore), and the polemic over Jesus' wife. (4 units) Upper-Division Courses: Scripture and Tradition (SCTR) 111. Bible and Ecology The Christian tradition has long been known for its anthropocentrism (human-centeredness), and traditional interpretations of the Bible have perpetuated the idea that God made the universe for humans, leaving other creatures to struggle amid both evolutionary forces and devastating human actions. What does the Bible really \"say\" about creation? What is the ethical significance of Jewish and Christian perspectives on the natural world, given our planet's threatened state? (5 units) 112. Martyrdom This course interrogates the role of sacred texts in legitimizing contemporary discourses on martyrdom or \"Dying in God.\" Crucial questions to explore include: What is martyrdom and its relationship to ancient notions of noble death? Why are notions of martyrdom so prevalent amongst Christian, Jewish, and Muslim fundamentalist groups today? How is the Torah, the Bible, and the Quran used to legitimate violence against the self and others? Key themes to explore include: notions of a noble death in antiquity, imperial violence (crucifixion), the book of Revelation, martyrdom in early Christianity, the Crusades, Jonestown, Branch Davidians, secularization, fundamentalism (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim), suicide bombing, school shootings, and the rise of the Islamic State.

Apocalypse Now This course provides a comparative introduction to ideas/symbols/theologies of the \"End of the World\" in three major monotheistic religions. In view of the influence of apocalyptic thought upon contemporary American culture in particular, and Western and non-Western societies in general, this course prepares students to responsibly engage in discussions of \"End of the World\" scenarios and their religious, socioeconomic, political implications. Themes germane to the course include: colonialism, environmental disasters (e.g., Pentecostalism), and alternative religious violence (e.g., Jonestown). In order to help students explore and articulate these themes, the course will provide various interpretive approaches from the theories and methods in the study of religion. We conclude the course by reflecting on the influence of apocalyptic thought upon our own spirituality, hopes, and religious traditions. (5 units) 157. The Bible and Empire This course explores how politics shaped the Bible as it was being written and as it has been interpreted. Specifically, we will study how the experiences of empires in antiquity colored the assumptions about power, the portrait of God, and narratives of salvation that fill biblical books. We will also examine how the Bible is implicated in recent imperial adventures, both as a tool of European and American empires, and as a liberating resource for those they colonized. Also listed as WGST 153. (5 units) 158.

Also listed as WGST 148. (5 units) 175. Wealth, Work, and the Gospel This course explores how Jews and Christians understood the significance of wealth and work in the Bible and in later interpretation of those texts.

How might they come together to promote the flourishing of the universe and all its creatures? This course engages religious perspectives on science from the standpoint of the world's religions, exploring how religion and science might cooperate for the good of all life on a planet threatened by ecological degradation. (4 units) 114. Latinx Pentecostal Christianities The course begins with the historical background of the Azusa Street Revival and the development of Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianities in Latinx communities in the United States.

(5 units) 122. Good and Evil This course explores the theological theme of good and evil, with a particular focus upon evil. The nature of the good requires our attention, but not our explanation. By definition, the good show be; we desire it, and desire that it be. Evil, on the other hand, arrests our attention and demands a response. Why is there evil? Whence does it come? Is there a \"solution\" to the problem of evil? Is our suffering simply meaningless? Can it be understood? Or should it merely be recognized? Most centrally, the question arises: what is the relationship between good, especially God, and evil? Should we hope? Can we? Is hell stronger than heaven? Does fire burn hotter than love? This is a text-driven course, built around \"primary sources,\" mainly of a historical nature.

Theological Anthropology and Artificial Intelligence This course will explore the developing field of artificial intelligence (AI) by placing it into conversation with a speculative reading of theological anthropology. Theological anthropology argues that human nature must be understood in relationship with the transcendent. An exemplar of this approach, Hans Urs von Balthasar explores how a relationship with the transcendent influences our use of logic and our understanding of truth. Balthasar argues that logic and truth operate in the four areas of: (1) nature, (2) freedom, (3) mystery, and (4) participation. Is machine intelligence possible without incorporating these themes into its programming? By aligning the machine to each of these four broad concerns, will the machine then become not only self-conscious, but also, aware of the existence of a transcendent being? Can an adequately complex algorithm and comprehensive logic engine create the equivalent of a machine soul? (5 units) 142. Conscience, Christianity, and Politics A study of the significant role that conscience has played in the history of Christian engagement with politics. We will study the meaning of conscience itself as it emerges in the works of great figures in the tradition.

Finally, conscience and Christianity and politics will be considered in light of crucial contextual matters like race and gender. (5 units) 143. Theology and Ethics of Thomas Aquinas A study of the life, thought, and ethics of Aquinas. Basic topics to be discussed include the existence of God, human nature, and human participation in society. (5 units) 148. Christian Ethics and Controversial Topics Have you ever wondered if Christians should take \"sides\" on public, controversial topics? Does Christian thought specify how we should begin to think about immigration, the death penalty, euthanasia, or racial justice? This course examines several contemporary social issues using the lenses of Christian theology and ethics, with a particular emphasis on Catholic Social Teaching. We will examine themes such as human dignity and human rights, the common good, economic justice, sin, solidarity, and a preferential option for the poor. In light of these themes, the course invites students to assess responses to various social topics, such as U.S. immigration, racism and civil rights, capital punishment, and state-sanctioned medically-assisted death. Although we will be using the lenses of Christian ethics to approach these topics, no assumptions will be made that students taking the course identify as Christian. (5 units) 149. Radical Theology: Death of God This course introduces the student to the discipline of radical theology as a controversial modern method of understanding God in light of secularization.

In the early 20th century, the institution of biomedicine became dominant, thus rendering religious approaches as quackery. Yet, religion-based approaches to healing resurged in the late 20th century due to the decline of medical authority and a convergence of the women's health movement, alternative spirituality, and patient's rights activism. From the 1970s to the 2000s, religion-based forms of healing moved from being considered \"alternative\" to \"integrative\" medicine by the medical establishment.

(5 units) 128. Religion and Popular Culture Examines the relationships between religious practice and culture expressions understood as appealing to the non-elite masses through various media (print, television, movies, music, etc.), personages (religious celebrities, entertainment celebrities, sports stars), embodied expressions and enhancements (clothing, jewelry, tattoos, piercings, etc.), and other material forms (mugs, water bottles, statues, posters, etc.).

(5 units) 145. Popular Culture in the Era of Mass Imprisonment In this class students will examine how popular culture in the era of mass imprisonment (approximately 1970-present) has socialized, reflected, and resisted the discourses central to driving and legitimizing the expansion of carceral control. We will discuss how particular tropes and narratives about crime and justice have been used to justify increasing police budgets and legal powers, as well as magnify restrictions and penalties against criminalized communities. Students will explore the ways that these stories and images have been represented in various forms of media (particularly film and television), and learn to connect these representations to the politics of carceral expansion prevalent at the time. Throughout this course we will discuss how storytelling, evolving technology, and cultural/artistic movements have been essential for convincing the public to see criminal threats as real and restrictive social control as necessary; at the same time, these have also been key for artists and organizers seeking to challenge the logic of law-and-order politics, reflect the experiences of those most impacted by these politics, or defend their communities from carceral state violence.

Billingslea (Department Chair, William J. Rewak Professor), Barbara M. Fraser, Barbara A. Murray Associate Professors: Jerald R. Enos, Kimberly M. Hill, David J. Popalisky Assistant Professor: Karina Gutiérrez, Leticia Ridley Senior Lecturers: Derek Duarte, Kristin Kusanovich Lecturers: Jeffrey Bracco, Karyn Connell, Pauline Locsin-Kanter, Patt Ness, Brian Thorstenson Emertitus: David Sword The Department of Theatre and Dance celebrates the creativity of the human spirit, offering a well-rounded education that leads to a bachelor of arts degree in Theatre Arts with emphasis in either theatre or dance. The department also offers minors in theatre, dance, theatre design and technology and musical theatre (an interdisciplinary minor offered in collaboration with the Department of Music). The program emphasizes academic rigor, artistic discipline, and creative expression. All students work closely with faculty and staff mentors. Majors fulfill all requirements set forth by the Undergraduate Core Curriculum, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Department of Theatre and Dance. Theatre and dance are distinct but related areas of emphasis. While each has its own set of disciplinary standards and academic requirements, students in each emphasis share some common courses (e.g., Introduction to Performance Collaboration, Defining the Performing Artist, etc.) The theatre emphasis offers coordinated courses in acting, design, theatre history, dramatic literature, technical production, directing, and playwriting. Students with this emphasis will have a broad foundation in theatrical practice and may choose to focus their study in any of the aforementioned areas. The dance emphasis offers coordinated classes in modern/contemporary dance, choreography, dance history, and provides additional training in ballet, jazz, hip-hop, and ethnic dance forms. Majors in either emphasis will complete their program with a senior project that demonstrates their proficiency in a chosen area. All students are encouraged to be creative in taking responsibility for their undergraduate education, working with advisors and mentors to plan programs that marry courses in their focus areas to other disciplines. Since courses in theatre and dance provide students with invaluable experience in collaboration, critical thinking, organizational management, and effective communication skills, they may profitably combine a major in theatre arts with a major (or minor) in almost any other discipline---especially English, music, communication, art, psychology, the sciences, or business. A degree in theatre arts prepares students for a variety of career options. Some students pursue graduate study in specialized focus areas so as to become professional theatre or dance artists and teachers. Others pursue careers in professional theatre or dance companies immediately after graduation. Still others have created their own theatre or dance companies or have ventured into the world of film, television, arts administration, and education. Many have used their performing arts experience to pursue careers in law, medicine, business, and marketing and development. The performance season, sponsored by the department, includes four faculty-directed plays and two dance concerts, in addition to student-directed plays and dance recitals. Participation in these productions is open to all members of the University community---students, faculty, and staff. Guest artists regularly direct, design, choreograph, and/or perform in productions with SCU students.

Visions of Abolition Abolition has a deep and rich history that originates in slavery abolition and connects to contemporary demands to abolish the prison industrial complex, policing, and ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement). But calls for abolition are as much about envisioning new worlds as they are about ending various oppressive and unjust institutions. \"Abolition,\" as Ruth Wilson Gilmore puts it, \"is about presence, not absence.\" In this course, we will survey different visions of abolition, paying particular attention to clarifying and evaluating the moral arguments made by abolitionists. What does it mean, exactly, to call for the abolition of an institution rather than for reforms? What are the justifications for and critiques of these radical re-imaginings of our socio-political structures? We will also investigate the intersection of abolitionist issues with race, nationality, class, gender, sexual orientation, and disability, among other dimensions of identity. Finally, we will examine ethical theories of abolition democracy and transformative justice: two notions that abolitionists employ when thinking through how to build life-affirming institutions and community-based accountability processes in place of carceral systems.

Global History of Sexually Transmitted Diseases This course will survey the impact of sexually transmitted infections in a variety of national contexts, from the early modern period to recent times. The focus is mainly upon the history of classic venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea as well as more recently HIV/AIDS. How have medical debates about sexual contagion both influenced and been influenced by cultural conventions of blame, stigma, and moral judgment? Do representations of STDs provide a window into how a society organizes gendered expectations and constructs an image of deviant sexuality? How have responses to the problem of STDs changed over time? Can we examine these changes to better understand broader cultural adjustments to issues as diverse as prostitution and promiscuity, medical treatment and prophylaxis, and the politics of feminism, gay rights, and patients rights. Cross Listed with HIST 124 (5 units) 168. Gender, Sexuality & Social Movements in the 20th U.S. In this course we will explore how race, gender and sexuality have shaped and been shaped by a century of social and political movements in the United States. We will move chronologically, exploring major movements and themes each week, beginning with a discussion of the uses of gender in historical analysis and ending with an exploration of current social movements. In between, we will read primary and secondary sources that illuminate the various, often contradictory, ways that ideas about race, gender and sexuality have influenced major social and political movements that continue to shape our world today.

Structural Racism: Race, Power and Resistance in the United States This seminar addresses systems of structural racism as they condition possibilities and threats to the health and well-being of publics in the United States. Structural racism is understood as 'the accumulation and incorporation of long-standing racialized practices into social and economic structures.' These patterns of racial discrimination work alongside gendered systems of heteronormativity to reinforce white supremacy and the inequitable distribution of social and economic resources, influencing multiple pathways to health and well-being. Through in-depth, discussion-based engagement with case studies of structural racism in interconnected systems of education, health, criminal justice, the law, policing, housing and employment, the seminar considers the critical role of anti-Black racism and white supremacy in entrenching racial inequality and harm at the systems level. Students will design projects to apply scholarship to critical anti-racist praxis. Also listed as PHSC 187. Enrollment by permission of instructor (2 units) Religious Studies Courses 21.

Sociology of Gender Gender is a central organizing principle in social relations giving rise to institutional and social practices that distinguish between men and women on the basis of apparent difference and inequality. This course develops the sociological analysis of gender systems in contemporary American society. In this course, we will critically examine the multiple ways that gender structures the social world in which we live, and the way that race and sexuality interact with gender. We will highlight social practices at multiple levels of analysis, including biological and socialization processes at the individual level. Next, we will explore how gender shapes the interactions between and among women and men, creating and recreating gender. We will then use this multilevel framework to examine the workings of gender in the American workplace and as individuals balance work and family obligations. Finally, we will conclude by considering the possibilities of a degendered or less-gendered society. The central goal throughout the course is to understand how gender roles and attitudes shape social structure, and how gender inequalities are maintained in everyday social situations.

These periods lay on the edge of modernity, when the distinctive characteristics of the contemporary world began to form and when major new connections were made between Europe and Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, and the Americas. Study of these periods from many different points of view affords an opportunity to gain valuable perspectives on the ways that Medieval and Renaissance people, events, and institutions helped to shape the modern world. Completion of the minor is noted on the student's transcript, and students receive a certificate acknowledging their accomplishment. Requirements for the Minor Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in Medieval and Renaissance studies: Seven courses selected from three different departments with a maximum of three lower-division courses. One of the upper-division courses must require an interdisciplinary research paper based on source materials and secondary works dealing with a topic rooted in the Medieval and/or Renaissance periods. The research paper requirement may be fulfilled by enrolling in MRST 199 under the supervision of an affiliated faculty member and the program director. The study of French, German, Greek, Italian, Latin, and/or Spanish is strongly recommended but not required. Students should consult with the program director to determine the cluster of courses best suited to their personal interests and preparation. Medieval and Renaissance Studies Courses 199.

Fedder Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. Most incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medicine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more attractive including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, public health professional, and others. A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by medical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the communication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school and in one's subsequent medical practice. Although Santa Clara does not have a pre-med major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. Most medical schools require: One year of general chemistry (CHEM 11, 12, and) One year of organic chemistry (CHEM 31, 32, and 33) One year of biology (BIOL 1A, 1B and 1C) One year of physics (PHYS 11, 12, and 13 or PHYS 31, 32, and 33) One year of mathematics, typically calculus (MATH 11 and 12), and a statistics course In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in biochemistry, genetics, and human physiology, which are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The combination of Core Curriculum requirements with the University's focus on community involvement and issues of diversity will prepare students well for the recently revised MCAT 2015, with its greater emphasis on social, economic, and psychological determinants of health. The choice of academic major is much less important than completing the coursework above; however, many pre-health students select a natural science major such as biology, biochemistry, chemistry, neuroscience, or public health science. Students should thoroughly examine the Pre-Health Advising website and should maintain regular contact with the pre-health advisor throughout their undergraduate years for assistance with adjusting to college academic rigor and social life; developing an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; achieving a balance between academics, social life, work, health community volunteering, and internships; selecting the relevant entrance examinations; and applying to graduate health science programs. "},"chapter-3/PreLaw.html":{"url":"chapter-3/PreLaw.html","title":"Pre-Law","keywords":"","body":"Pre-Law Advisors: Mike Dana, Melissa Donegan, Matthew Harrigan, Diana Morlang, Lawrence Nelson, Terri Peretti Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their undergraduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors to help determine whether or not a career in law matches their particular interests and strengths. Consultation with a pre-law advisor familiarizes the student with the rigors of law school, the practice of law, the burden of law school debt, and the means to best secure employment as an attorney. Advisors will help formulate a program to prepare students for the complexity of the application process, including preparation for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Successful law school applicants come from a diversity of majors such as anthropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biology, and economics. However, to successfully prepare for the LSAT, students are advised to select courses that deepen reading comprehension and promote logical reasoning. Law school admissions officers generally recommend undergraduate preparation by selecting courses that demand discipline, analytical ability, research skills, close reading of texts, creativity, verbal skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of philosophy and political science offer a pre-law emphasis within the major (in philosophy, it is also available within the minor). Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experience. Some elective courses strengthen specific abilities, while others provide perspective on legal issues and topics.

The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades. Each credential program includes content for teaching English learners that authorizes the credential holder to provide instruction for English language development and specially designed academic instruction in English within the subject area and grade level authorization. Bilingual authorization in Spanish is also available. The teaching credential program at SCU is combined with a Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Students interested in TK--12 teaching should consider completing an interdisciplinary minor in urban education offered through the College of Arts and Sciences. The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area, who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to undergraduate studies and the credential/MAT program. The FTP is managed through the Child Studies Program in the College of Arts and Sciences. Preparation for Multiple-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in elementary or middle school teaching generally earn a bachelor's degree before entering into a post-graduate teacher credential program. Students who would like to teach TK--8 (self-contained classroom) in California are strongly encouraged to select from majors such as psychology, child studies, or sociology within the College of Arts and Sciences, though any undergraduate major is acceptable. The undergraduate program of study, including the Core Curriculum, should encompass the range of subjects taught in grade school and include courses that have field-based learning placements in settings that directly serve school-aged children. The SCU undergraduate Core Curriculum provides a broad education in English, mathematics, science, social science, the arts, and humanities, all of which will be valuable preparation to become an elementary school teacher. Students are recommended to pursue the interdisciplinary minor in urban education to participate in undergraduate pre-teaching coursework. Those requirements can be found in the Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study section in this chapter. Students must demonstrate the subject matter competency component for the multiple-subject credential by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET) for Multiple Subjects. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills (see below for additional information on this requirement). Preparation for Single-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in secondary school teaching in a particular subject matter area are advised to fulfill the requirements of the academic major of their intended teaching specialization. California teaching credentials are available in the following subject areas: agriculture, art, biological sciences, business, chemistry, English, geosciences, health science, home economics, industrial and technology education, mathematics, music, physical education, physics, general sciences, social science, and world languages other than English. Students must demonstrate specific subject matter competency by passing the CSET in the subject area they desire to teach. Completing an undergraduate major in this subject area is not required but it is highly recommended. An undergraduate interdisciplinary minor in urban education is also recommended. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills (see below for additional information on this requirement). Requirements for Multiple-Subject and Single-Subject Credentials The minimum requirements for the multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential include: A bachelor's degree in a subject area from an accredited institution Demonstrated knowledge of the United States Constitution by completion of undergraduate coursework on the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution such as POLI 1 or HIST 96A, -or passage of an approved examination Demonstrated basic educational skills by completing one of the following: California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST); CSET: Multiple Subjects Plus Writing Skills Examination; CSU Early Assessment Program or the CSU Placement Examinations (English and Mathematics sections); Achieve Qualifying Score on the SAT or ACT; College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations (English and Calculus or Statistics); Basic Skills Examination from a state other than California. Completion of an approved program of professional education, including field experience achieved through student teaching or internship Completion of a state-approved subject matter preparation program, or passage of the CSET, a subject-area competency examination, in the area one plans to teach For multiple-subject credential candidates only: Demonstrated knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading by passing the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA) examination School of Education and Counseling Psychology Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential can be completed as part of the Masters of Arts in Teaching and Teaching Credential (MATTC) program. This program requires a fifth year of study following the bachelor's degree and qualifies the student for a preliminary teaching credential. The MATTC program includes graduate coursework in educational foundations, curriculum design, teaching methods, and supervised student teaching. Bilingual authorization in Spanish is also available. Students seeking additional information regarding the MATTC program with a multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential should contact the Advisor of PreTeaching or the Graduate Admissions Office in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology.

This practical discipline provides insights into important issues such as the determinants of wealth and poverty; unemployment, inflation, international trade, and economic growth; and success and failure in the marketplace. The rigorous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Economics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting. Students considering graduate study in economics leading to a master's or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appropriate course of study.

Harvard Business School cases give students the opportunity to learn from the most critical business and policy decisions of our times. Putting students in the role of decision-maker challenges them to understand the complexity of decision making and leadership, and begins to train them for their careers post SCU. Leadership Development Teams (LDTs) are small, mentored groups. The goal is for students to explore and share their authentic selves and develop the courage to live as their authentic selves in their careers and lives.

It is also the firm's voice, handling communications with customers and deciding on advertising, sales, and social media messages. Finally, strategic marketing addresses competitive threats and opportunities, guiding a firm's efforts to deliver superior value. Because customer analysis and competitive advantage are so crucial to business success, a degree in marketing provides a solid foundation for a general management career leading to executive responsibilities. It can also provide the basis for a more focused career in such areas as advertising, retailing, sales, brand management, and market research.

To meet these challenges, the Department of Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering offers a well-balanced undergraduate program that develops graduates capable of solving complex problems with fixed and often limited resources. The application of state-of-the-art skills, a sound understanding of engineering principles, concepts of sustainability and resilience in design, the ability to communicate and articulate ideas, and preparation for lifelong learning are some of the key areas of focus in the civil, environmental and sustainable engineering curriculum. At the completion of the undergraduate program, graduates are well equipped to enter the practice or pursue advanced studies in any of the civil engineering disciplines. The department provides students with the necessary guidance to develop their full potential within the context of their own personal experiences, the expectations of the profession, and societal needs. Our graduates become civil engineers with primary responsibility for planning, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining infrastructure critical to public welfare, safety, and the expectations of daily life---including buildings, transportation systems, airports, irrigation systems, water supplies, supply systems, and environmental protection facilities. The Department of Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering works with its advisory board and other key constituencies to produce the program's educational objectives shown below.

This program is open to majors with an approved grade point average in electrical and computer engineering, mathematics, and physics courses. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bachelor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science in electrical and computer engineering within a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree. Undergraduate students interested in the combined degree program are required to apply for the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the full undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master's degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 46 units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. However, completion of 10 or more units of coursework in electrical and computer engineering taken for the master's degree satisfies the professional development requirement of the undergraduate program. The program of studies for the master's degree may include up to 20 units of electrical and computer engineering upper-division elective coursework excluding ELEN 188 and 189. These undergraduate units can count toward a master's degree only if a grade of \"B\" or better is earned. Students who do not complete the combined degree program within six years of entering the University will automatically be transferred to the regular master's degree program. Although six years is the maximum timeframe for completing the combined degree, full-time students enrolling in February of their junior year normally complete both degrees within five years.

Mechanical engineering is essential to the proper design and manufacture of nearly every physical product in our modern world. As such, mechanical engineers are a fundamental resource for most industries, and they work in interdisciplinary environments. Mechanical engineers must have the ability to see both broad perspectives across disciplines and industries, and solve very local and specialized problems. The undergraduate curriculum addresses the education and training of mechanical engineering students and concentrates on two technical areas: (1) design and analysis of thermofluid systems for effective use of energy; and (2) design, analysis, and control of mechanical systems including the use of materials. The Mechanical Engineering educational program develops future engineers with a solid understanding of fundamentals and competence in analyzing engineering systems. The undergraduate Mechanical Engineering Program will educate students that can: Demonstrate their knowledge and depth of understanding of mechanical engineering in engineering practice and principles through professional success or attainment of advanced degrees. Design and development components, systems, tests, or services that meet specifications in the context of economic, environmental, and societal requirements. Develop engineering solutions based on fundamental principles using modern analysis techniques, testing, and validation. Work in a team environment, share their knowledge and expertise, and exercise leadership as appropriate. Communicate effectively with colleagues, customers, subordinates, and managers. Act ethically and professionally in their careers. Continue to learn and grow professionally.

The Military Science Program is designed to develop management skills and leadership abilities for successful careers in both the corporate world and the military. Students who complete the ROTC program are eligible for appointment and commissioning as officers in the United States Army. The military science core curriculum consists of six lower-division classes in the ROTC Basic Course and seven upper-division courses in the ROTC Advanced Course. Cadets may take a summer course (MILS 24) in lieu of the six lower-division courses. The professional military education of ROTC cadets consists of two components: a baccalaureate degree from Santa Clara University (or one of the cross-enrolled universities) and at least one undergraduate course from each of five designated fields of study. Prior to commissioning, cadets must take at least one course in military history. For those planning on commissioning into the U.S. Army, the curriculum is divided into ROTC Basic Course requirements and ROTC Advanced Course requirements. To proceed to the ROTC Advanced Course classes, students must complete either the six required ROTC Basic Course classes or attend a summer class at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The director of the Military Science Program must approve exceptions to this progression. ROTC Basic Course Requirements The ROTC Basic Course, Fundamentals of Leadership and Management, includes the first-year and second-year courses (MILS 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23) designed for beginning students who want to qualify for entry into the ROTC Advanced course and for those students who may want to try military science without obligations. A student can also qualify for entry in the ROTC Advanced Course by completing the summer training camp (MILS 24). ROTC Advanced Course Requirements The ROTC Advanced Course, Advanced Leadership and Management, consists of the third-year and fourth-year courses (MILS 131, 132, 133, 134, 141, 142, and 143) open to students who have completed or earned placement credit for the ROTC Basic Course. Students must complete all courses numbered greater than MILS 130, to include MILS 134, a six-week Cadet Leader Course during the summer, in sequence, unless otherwise approved by the professor of military science. The ROTC Advanced Course qualifies students for commissions as officers in the U.S. Army. Students who do not desire to compete for a commission as an officer in the Army may take these courses for academic credit with approval by the professor of military science. Leadership Laboratories Leadership laboratories, held weekly for three hours, are required of all students. Performance during lab periods is reflected in the student's course grade. Labs include activities such as terrain navigation, first aid training, virtual battle simulations, drill and ceremonies, and tactical leader development exercises. Laboratory and Field Exercises During each quarter of class work, weekly lab work is required. Two off-campus exercises involving adventure training, leadership training, and survival skills are optional for non-scholarship ROTC Basic Course students.

Programs are available during the fall, winter, and spring may be highly competitive and not all qualified applicants may be approved. Study abroad during the summer is not competitive. Students may study abroad during the summer following their first year, sophomore year, or junior year. Students studying abroad during the fall, winter, or spring terms may do so once during their time as an undergraduate at Santa Clara Many study abroad programs operate on a semester system with resulting units earned exceeding the usual maximum for courses completed on campus. Academic calendars abroad may differ significantly from the on-campus academic calendar at the University. Because the programs with which Santa Clara University is affiliated vary in length, each program is evaluated to determine the appropriate maximum and minimum units for the program. Approved programs offer students opportunities to integrate with the host culture and foster personal reflection in the context of rigorous study. Programs may allow students to pursue independent research, attend classes with local students, participate in community-based learning, or gain professional experience through academic internships, which, in turn, can serve as a basis for senior capstone projects. During their first two years at Santa Clara, students build a foundation for the academic work they will pursue abroad. Students are encouraged to work with their academic advisor early to plan for study abroad, and to explore their goals with Study Abroad staff. Global Engagement values diversity and inclusion and encourages students from all backgrounds to apply for study abroad. In addition, Santa Clara students are strongly encouraged to pursue opportunities in traditionally underrepresented geographic areas of the world. The goal is for student learning in the approved programs to build on and extend the on-campus curriculum. Students from underrepresented academic disciplines such as the sciences, engineering, and fine and performing arts are strongly urged to apply. Study abroad at Santa Clara University is a privilege, not a right. The application process is competitive and not all qualified applicants may be approved. The selection process is designed to offer study abroad opportunities to students who have thoughtfully selected programs that will significantly advance their academic and professional goals. Students are strongly encouraged to study abroad for a summer, quarter, or semester in a country and academic environment that will enrich their overall college experience and engender responsible participation in a global, multicultural society. Credit earned during study abroad counts toward graduation requirements either as elective credit or, with appropriate approval, may fulfill major, minor, and Core requirements. Grades are calculated into the Santa Clara University GPA, and all credit and grades appear on the Santa Clara University transcript. The University is committed to offering equal access to study abroad opportunities and therefore extends all available financial aid to students to support study abroad during the fall, winter, and spring. Matriculated students who study abroad while withdrawn from the University, are ineligible for financial aid and scholarships, and financial aid is not available for summer study abroad programs. The study abroad application process is a two-step process: (1) approval of the application by the Study Abroad Office; then (2) approval of a program-specific application by the study abroad program. In addition, participation is contingent upon satisfactory completion of all program prerequisites and related courses, satisfactory academic progress toward the student's major, and participation in study abroad mandatory pre-departure orientation and re-entry meetings. Normally, students apply for study abroad six months to one year prior to participation. During the selection process, the Study Abroad staff and faculty and staff reviewers from departments across the University review applications.The Office reserves the right to redirect students to alternate programs due to institutional considerations. To apply for study abroad, students must be admitted to degree status at the University, have declared a major with the Office of the Registrar, and expect to have completed a minimum of 88 quarter units by the start of the academic program abroad. Normally, students participate in study abroad during their junior or senior year, but sophomores with extenuating academic circumstances may request an exception to the eligibility policy. Santa Clara requires a cumulative grade point average of 2.75 for off-campus study; requirements for individual programs may be more rigorous. Successful applicants will meet or exceed Santa Clara's requirements and that of their proposed program. Priority admission may be given to applicants for Santa Clara's own programs, including exchanges. Students must receive approval through the on-campus application process to receive credit for major, minor, or Core requirements completed through study abroad. Students on academic or disciplinary probation or any form of suspension are not eligible to apply for or participate on any study abroad programs. Students who earn a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in any course in the term preceding their program may become ineligible for off-campus study. Students must clear any outstanding balances with the Bursar's Office in accordance with the Bursar's Office payment schedule to remain eligible for participation. The University does not approve study in countries or areas with a U.S. Department of State (DOS) Travel Advisory Level 3 or 4, see https://www.scu.edu/globalengagement/global-opportunities/health--safety/. Withdrawn students who study abroad independently may be eligible to receive a maximum of 10 units of elective credit toward graduation requirements, in keeping with the University's policy on transfer credit---the University's transfer credit policy does not allow credit earned while withdrawn from the University to count toward a student's major, minor, or Core requirements. Students should consult the policies governing units taken at other institutions in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations. For detailed information about individual programs, including eligibility requirements, visit the website at http://www.scu.edu/globalengagement/study-abroad/, or email studyabroad\\@scu.edu. Students are urged to attend a Study Abroad 101 session to gain general information and contact a Study Abroad advisor in Global Engagement, located on the first floor of Varsi Hall, for information about the competitive application process. Current approved study abroad programs are listed on the SCU Study Abroad website at http://www.scu.edu/globalengagement/study-abroad/. Note: Santa Clara University may be obliged to alter or eliminate programs at any time. Global Explorations The Study Abroad Office administers short-term, faculty-led programs through our Global Explorations Program. These programs are offered during the summer and typically run for three to four weeks abroad. Subjects vary from year to year based on the faculty teaching, consequently students should consult the website for current and future program offerings.

Summer Sessions invites students to reach their educational goals through the convenience of accelerated courses. Over 140 summer courses are held on campus and online. Sessions are three, five, and 10 weeks in length. Eight (8) units constitutes full-time status for undergraduate students enrolled in summer courses. Content, prerequisites, and units of summer courses are equivalent to fall, winter, and spring courses. Academic Regulations Most of the academic regulations that apply in the fall, winter, and spring quarters also apply to the summer terms. Courses taken during summer sessions are included in the records of matriculated Santa Clara University students for the determination of GPA, class level, honors, probation, and disqualification. Any student who is not permitted to register during fall, winter, or spring quarters (e.g. disqualified, suspension) may not enroll for summer courses at SCU. Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment The Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment policy is not in effect during the summer as it is during the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Students who are officially enrolled in a class and fail to attend the first and any subsequent class meetings will remain enrolled in the class and be responsible for paying all tuition and fees associated with the class. Students are responsible for dropping a course if they are unable to attend due to changes in the class schedule or personal obligations. Non-attendance does NOT relieve a student of the obligation to pay tuition and fees. In addition to paying full tuition and fees, an academic hold will be placed on the student's account to prevent any further registration transactions. Students who do not formally drop a class for which they are officially enrolled will receive an \"F\" grade for the course(s), and be liable for all tuition and fees incurred during the summer. Students must formally drop a course via eCampus or by submitting a Drop Form to the Enrollment Services Center prior to the published deadlines. Auditing Courses Non-SCU and non-degree seeking SCU students may not audit courses. Degree-seeking students may audit one course in addition to the summer sessions course load limit on a space available basis. Students will be charged a course audit fee. Permission to audit must be given by the instructor by the last day to add a class. Students should submit completed audit forms to the Enrollment Services Center by the last day to add a class. Course Load Limits Policy/Overload Policy There are NO EXCEPTIONS to the course load policy for summer sessions. Students who register for more than the maximum course load will be administratively withdrawn from the course that creates the overload. Students who add overload units in violation of this policy may not receive credit for the course that causes the policy violation. The intensive pace of Sessions 1, 2, and 3 require the following restrictions on summer course loads: Session 1 Students may not enroll in more than 10 units during this session Session 2 Students may not enroll in more than 10 units during this session Session 3 (A, B, and C): Students may not enroll in or attend more than one Session 3 lab science (chemistry or physics) course at a time If enrolled in or attending a Session 3 lab science course, students may not be simultaneously enrolled in or attending any Session 1, 2, or 4 course Course Cancellations Santa Clara University reserves the right to make changes in the schedules or policies without prior notice or obligation. If a course is canceled, the Summer Sessions Office will immediately send a notification to enrolled students at their \\@scu.edu address. Students should check their SCU email daily. Enrollment and Course Restriction Policy Students may not sit in classes without formally enrolling. Credit is not given to students who attend class without formally enrolling and paying tuition. Students must be officially registered in classes based on the procedures outlined on the Summer Sessions website and must have paid all tuition and fees by the published deadlines. The instructor's signature on an add form after the add period does not constitute a formal enrollment without tuition payment. Initial registration or class additions will not be accepted beyond the late registration/add period as set forth in the Summer Sessions calendar. Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to administrative withdrawal from that course. This includes: Students who have not satisfied course prerequisites Students who have not obtained the instructor's permission as specified in certain courses Independent Study Eligible Santa Clara University students may pursue independent study with the approval of a faculty member.

The student may be afforded an opportunity to present the results of the research to the class. Honors Contract courses may be especially valuable in the student's junior year as a precursor to the senior thesis. Students wishing to establish a contract for Honors credit must turn in the appropriate application to the office by the end of the first week of the quarter in which the course is taken. "},"chapter-7/AdmissionofUndergraduateStudents.html":{"url":"chapter-7/AdmissionofUndergraduateStudents.html","title":"Chapter 7: Admission of Undergraduate Students","keywords":"","body":"Admission of Undergraduate Students Santa Clara University is a selective admission university that admits new students based on past performance, potential for future academic success, and contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Applicants are admitted as full-time, degree-seeking students. Santa Clara does not have a part-time undergraduate program option and does not enroll non-degree students except international non-degree students participating in an approved international partnership. Non-degree international student programs are administered by Global Engagement. See the limited conditions outlined in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations. Entering first-year and transfer students are admitted for fall and winter terms. Students are admitted for spring term only by special exception with the approval of the dean of admission. Entering first-year students are admitted to the University and to a specific school and in some cases major based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schools may apply for a transfer only at the end of their first year of attendance. Admission of Entering First-Year Students Admission of applicants to Santa Clara University as entering first-year students is based on their academic record in high school including course rigor, results on standardized tests when submitted, and other criteria outlined below. While Santa Clara University does not have a specific high school grade point average or standardized test score requirement, potential for successful academic performance in the rigorous undergraduate program at Santa Clara is correlated with high academic performance in high school. Santa Clara also bases admission on demonstrated potential for contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University, but only after assessment of academic performance and potential. Applications for admission as an entering first-year student are evaluated using the following criteria: Overall quality of high school courses and appropriately challenging coursework Academic performance in high school, including the cumulative grade point average from the first year of high school through the junior year of high school (grades from the first term of the senior year may also be included) Results of standardized SAT or ACT tests (optional) One teacher evaluation from an 11th or 12th grade core academic class Involvement in school and community activities The basic subject recommendations for admission as an entering first-year students includes: History and Social Science: 3 years English: 4 years Mathematics: 3 years required; 4 years recommended Laboratory Science: 2 years required; 3 years recommended Language other than English: 2 years required; 3 years recommended; 4 years preferred Visual and Performing Arts: 1 year recommended College Preparatory Electives: 1 year Admission to first-year student standing at Santa Clara depends on a continued high level of performance during the remainder of the applicant's senior year in the curriculum provided on the application and upon receipt of a high school diploma. If a significant change occurs in the applicant's academic performance during the senior year, his or her admission status may be reevaluated by the University. Early Decision I Track Applicants to the Early Decision I Track must submit complete applications by November 1 of their senior year. Early Decision applicants are notified of the final admission decision by the end of December. Santa Clara's Early Decision I Track is a binding program that requires commitment and confirmation of intent to enroll by those admitted under this program. Financial aid awards will be sent to admitted students who meet deadlines for filing required forms. Deposits must be received by January 7. After admission, all applications for admission to other colleges or universities must be withdrawn. Some Early Decision I applicants who are competitive but not clearly admissible will be deferred and evaluated with other applicants under the Regular Decision Track. Students denied under the Early Decision I Track may not reapply under the Regular Decision Track for the same academic year. Applicants with alumni ties will receive the most consideration for their affiliation with the University during the Early Decision I process. Early Action Track Applicants to the Early Action Track must submit their applications by November 1 of their senior year. Early Action applicants are notified of the admissions decision by the end of December. Santa Clara's Early Action Track is nonbinding; consequently, students admitted under the Early Action Track are not required to withdraw other college applications and have until May 1 to confirm enrollment at Santa Clara. Some Early Action applicants who are competitive but not clearly admissible will be deferred and evaluated with other applicants under their choice of Regular Decision Track or Early Decision II Track. Students denied under the Early Action Track may not reapply under the Regular Decision Track for the same academic year. Early Decision II Track Applicants to the Early Decision II Track must submit complete applications by January 7 of their senior year. Early Decision II applicants are notified of the final admission decision by mid-February. Santa Clara's Early Decision II Track is a binding program that requires commitment and confirmation of intent to enroll by those admitted under this program. Financial aid awards will be sent to admitted students who meet deadlines for filing required forms. Deposits must be received by March 1. After admission, all applications for admission to other colleges or universities must be withdrawn. Applicants with alumni ties will receive the most consideration for their affiliation with the University during the Early Decision II process.

Admission of applicants to Santa Clara University as entering transfer students is based on their academic record at other colleges or universities in conjunction with evaluation of an official high school transcript and other criteria outlined below. While Santa Clara University does not have a specific grade point requirement, potential for successful academic performance in the rigorous undergraduate program at Santa Clara is highly correlated with prior academic performance in challenging courses. Santa Clara also bases admission on demonstrated potential for contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Transfer applicants for fall term are notified of the admissions decision on a rolling basis until enrollment capacity has been reached. Applicants for admission to Santa Clara University as entering transfer students must have completed at least 8 semester or 12 quarter transferable units at an accredited college or university. Applicants with fewer than 8 semester or 12 quarter transferable units at the time of application should follow the application procedure for entering first-year students. Note that if a transfer applicant has not already completed 30 semester or 45 quarter transferable units when the application is submitted, it is optional to submit an official SAT or ACT score report for consideration. The entire academic history of the applicant is considered in the admission review. Course selection and consistency of performance by the applicant are also considered. Applicants on academic or disciplinary probation or suspension at another institution are not considered for admission. Recommended Courses for Transfer Students Applicants for admission to Santa Clara University as entering transfer students enhance their chances for admission by completing as many courses that fulfill the Santa Clara Core Curriculum requirements as possible before transferring. Preference will be given to students who have completed the following courses: College of Arts and Sciences English Composition (2 semesters or 2 quarters) College-level Mathematics: 2 semesters or 2 quarters for bachelor of science 1 semester or 1 quarter for bachelor of arts Natural Science with a Lab (1 semester or 1 quarter) Leavey School of Business English Composition (2 semesters or 2 quarters) Calculus and Analytic Geometry (2 semesters or 2 quarters) Accounting (2 semesters or 3 quarters) Microeconomics and Macroeconomics (1 semester or 1 quarter each) School of Engineering English Composition (2 semesters or 2 quarters) Calculus and Analytic Geometry (2 semesters or 3 quarters) Chemistry (1 semester or 1 quarter) Physics (2 semesters or 3 quarters) Transfer Credit Entering transfer students generally receive credit after admission for courses from other colleges and universities that are similar to courses offered at Santa Clara University. Courses from accredited institutions are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer. Transfer credit is awarded only for courses in which the student earned a grade of \"C\" or better. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not eligible for transfer* (see Note below for Spring 2020 term exceptions). Students may transfer a maximum of 58.33 semester or 87.5 quarter units to the College of Arts and Sciences or the Leavey School of Business. The School of Engineering will grant credit for up to one-half of the degree requirements toward the major. (Note: Spring 2020 Term Exception: Regarding transfer credits for work completed in Spring Term 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, course work receiving a grade of Pass or Credit is transferable. We encourage students continuing on in those subject areas to consult with their departments and advisors to ensure they are adequately prepared for the next level courses.)

Requirements for academic majors can be found under the departmental listings in the chapters for each respective college or school. Students must declare their primary academic major by the end of the sophomore year. Students may declare a major at the time of initial matriculation, except in the Leavey School of Business where declaration of a major is normally made during sophomore year. Students who initially matriculate without a declared major must obtain the approval of the department chair of the intended major and submit the online Program Petition form. Students participating in study abroad or domestic public sector study programs must declare a major before participating in the program. Students may declare a second academic major in addition to their primary major; however, students in the Leavey School of Business may only declare a second major in the College of Arts and Sciences or the School of Engineering. Students who want to declare a second major must obtain the approval of the department chair of the intended major and the college/school for the second major if different from the student's primary major and submit the online Program Petition form. To be awarded a second major, a student must complete all requirements of the Core Curriculum, college or school, and departmental requirements for that major. Requirements for a second major are as binding as those of a primary major and must be completed before a degree will be awarded. If a student decides to drop a second major, he or she must submit the online Program Petition form. Academic Minors Students may declare an academic minor from among the departmental minors offered through the college or schools, the general minor in engineering, or one of the interdisciplinary minors offered by the University. Requirements for the academic minors can be found in the chapters of the respective college or school in this Bulletin. Students who want to declare an academic minor must obtain the approval of the department chair or program director of the intended minor and submit a Program Petition form to the Enrollment Services Center. Some minors may require an application process and are limited based on space available. To be awarded a minor, a student must complete all requirements of the minor as prescribed. Requirements for a minor are binding and must be completed before a degree will be awarded. If a student decides to drop a minor, he or she must submit the online Program Petition form. Second Bachelor's Degree A student may earn a second bachelor's degree at Santa Clara University, but may not duplicate a degree (i.e., bachelor of arts, bachelor of science in a natural science, bachelor of science in a social science, bachelor of science in commerce, bachelor of science in engineering). Students whose first degree is from Santa Clara and who are interested in pursuing a second bachelor's degree concurrently or without interruption must have an academic record showing a strong probability of success and a proposed program of study for the second degree that fulfills the degree requirements in effect at their original date of matriculation. At least half of the units for the second degree must be in addition to those required for the first degree and must be completed through a Santa Clara program. Approval to pursue a second bachelor's degree must be granted by the Dean of Academic Support Services and filed with the Office of the Registrar. If a student is returning to the University after an absence, they must meet the criteria outlined above, but is subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of re-entry. Approval from the Dean of Academic Support Services is required to resume studies for a second degree after an absence. Students whose first degree is from an institution other than Santa Clara must submit a formal application for admission to the Office of Undergraduate Admission. The application must specify that the second degree will not duplicate any other degree. Students admitted for a second bachelor's degree are subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of admission. At least half the units required for the second bachelor's degree must be earned through a Santa Clara program. Graduation with Honors Candidates for a bachelor's degree with a grade point average between 3.500 and 3.699 graduate cum laude (with honors); candidates with a grade point average between 3.700 and 3.899 graduate magna cum laude (with high honors); and candidates with a grade point average of 3.900 or higher graduate summa cum laude (with highest honors). For the purposes of calculating Latin honors, grade point averages are not rounded. Awarding of honors is based on all graded undergraduate courses attempted at Santa Clara University that are counted toward the fulfillment of a student's degree. Honors will not be awarded above those merited by the student's record at Santa Clara. An indication of honors at graduation contained in the commencement program is unofficial. The final determination will be made after a review of all completed undergraduate courses counted toward the degree. Participation in Commencement To participate in commencement, candidates for a bachelor's degree must have completed all degree requirements (or must be within the equivalent of one quarter -- no more than 20 units -- see conditions below) and a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 as well as a minimum 2.0 GPA in all courses in their academic major(s) and academic minor(s). Candidates must submit a Pre-Graduation Evaluation form, signed by the student's academic department, to the Office of the Registrar. Candidates whose degrees will not be conferred in spring must clearly demonstrate that all coursework will be completed by the end of fall quarter immediately following June Commencement, must have the endorsement of their department, and must have completed and submitted, in addition to the Pre-Graduation Evaluation form, the Permission to Participate in Commencement form, by the relevant deadlines to the Office of the Registrar. "},"chapter-8/AcademicProgramPoliciesandRegulations.html":{"url":"chapter-8/AcademicProgramPoliciesandRegulations.html","title":"Academic Program Policies and Regulations","keywords":"","body":"Academic Program Policies and Regulations Course Numbering and Course Credits Lower-division courses are numbered 1 through 99, and upper-division courses are numbered 100 through 199. In the College of Arts and Sciences and the Leavey School of Business, most lower-division courses carry 4 units of academic credit and most upper-division courses carry 5 units of academic credit. In the School of Engineering, unit values for courses vary according to the number of hours in class per week. Credit Unit Policy Academic work at Santa Clara University is measured by credit unit. A unit of credit represents that amount of time and effort both within and outside of formal settings that a student devotes to a particular class. At the undergraduate level, one unit of credit represents approximately three hours of work per week per term by the student, including time engaged in class and time committed to class preparation, studying, and assigned projects. A unit of credit for laboratory courses, independent study, internships, practica, and study abroad is awarded on the same basis as for a lecture course: One unit of credit represents approximately three hours of work per week per term by the student. At the graduate level, course credit is determined by the college or school and is consistent with practices in the disciplines. Change of Academic Major A change of major within the same school or college requires the approval of the relevant department chair or program director. Students wishing to change their academic major within a school must submit the online Program Petition form. Change of School Entering first-year students are admitted to the University and to a specific school based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schools within the University may not apply for such a change until the end of their first year of attendance. Changes between schools may be limited by the availability of space within the school and the specific academic major. Students wishing to change schools must meet the admittance criteria of the school and complete the application process specified by that school. Upon acceptance by the school, the student must submit a completed Program Petition form to the Enrollment Services Center. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than \"C-.\" In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the calculation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and performance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion. Students should consult the chair of the department in which the course is offered to confirm that a given course may be repeated for credit. Independent Study Students may pursue independent study through directed reading, directed research, internships, practica, or cooperative education. To qualify, a student must have demonstrated a sufficient knowledge of the academic discipline involved to make independent study both possible and beneficial. No more than 20 units of independent study may be used to satisfy graduation requirements, and no more than 5 units of independent study may be taken per term. Students must enroll for the term in which the independent study occurs and complete the online Undergraduate Petition for Independent Study. Directed reading and directed research are limited to upper-division students who undertake a research project or other well-defined study beyond the scope of a regular course under the supervision of a faculty member. Such work should be comparable to that required for courses of equivalent unit value. Students can obtain practical learning experience through internships, cooperative education, and practica. Internships and cooperative education are approved work experiences in a non-classroom environment in industry, government, or other setting, generally available only to upper-division students. Students who enroll in an internship or cooperative education experience for academic credit must fulfill specified academic requirements in addition to the responsibilities expected by the organization hosting the internship or cooperative education experience. Practica provide practical experience in a discipline-specific field experience or an approved University program activity, such as participation on the school newspaper staff. Practica are generally available only to upper-division students, but some practicum experiences are available to lower-division students who meet specified eligibility criteria. Students wishing to enroll in an independent study course must initiate the request for independent study with the appropriate faculty member, or with the Career Center for cooperative education experiences. The appropriate form, with the required materials and other approvals, must be submitted to the Drahmann Center for final approval prior to registering for the course. Challenging Courses In rare circumstances, students may petition to challenge a course by examination in order to fulfill a course prerequisite or degree requirement. Since most courses at Santa Clara University require laboratory, studio, discussion, and/or group work, which cannot be evaluated by examination, approval to challenge courses will be unusual. Departments have full discretion to determine which of their courses, if any, may be challenged. To challenge a course, a student must demonstrate mastery of the course content and learning objectives, as well as any additional requirements specified by the department that offers the course being challenged. A successful challenge neither earns units toward graduation nor contributes to the fulfillment of residency requirements. In order to be eligible to challenge a course, a student must have completed at least one term at Santa Clara, have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, and receive permission of the course instructor and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. Only currently enrolled students are eligible to challenge a course. Students may not attempt to challenge a particular course more than once. Students wishing to challenge a course must complete a Course Challenge Petition (available from the Office of the Registrar), which provides evidence of circumstances justifying the challenge, and submit the form to the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If approved, the department chair arranges the examination after the student files the Course Challenge Petition with the Office of the Registrar and pays the applicable fee. The examination will be administered and evaluated by the department that offers the course. If successful, the department chair will notify the Registrar that the requirement has been fulfilled. Undergraduate Class Attendance Policy Students are responsible for completing all course requirements as set forth by the instructor. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absences from class are left to the discretion of individual instructors subject to restrictions imposed by law, including, but not limited to, policies associated with the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act (ADAAA) and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) (see below). The instructor's policies will be communicated clearly in writing. Students are accountable for all course assignments, whether or not the assignments were announced during an absence, and for meeting assigned deadlines, even when the deadline falls on the day a student is absent from class. For details on grading, see the Grading Policies and Regulations section in this chapter. In certain situations involving unavoidable absence, students may be offered the opportunity to make up a missed assignment/activity or to complete an alternative assignment, unless the design of the course offers no opportunity for in-class work to be made up. These include both foreseen and unforeseen documented and verified situations such as: Serious personal illness Death of immediate family member Participation in significant religious observances Participation in events or activities as official representatives of Santa Clara University In cases of unforeseen, unavoidable absence, students should contact the instructor as soon as possible. Under certain circumstances, the Cowell Center or the Office of Student Life may contact the instructor on behalf of the student. In cases of foreseen absence due to significant religious observances or official representation of the University in events, students should discuss the conflict with the instructor well in advance of the absence in order to determine possible alternate arrangements. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absence are left to the discretion of individual instructors. Instructors may require documentation from the appropriate University personnel regarding the reason for the intended absence. Title IX: Pregnant and Parenting Students Santa Clara University is committed to maintaining an equitable learning environment and supporting the academic success of pregnant and parenting students. The University prohibits discrimination based on parental status, pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery from related conditions in all of its educational programs and activities pursuant to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Students may request an accommodation for pregnancy-related conditions or parenting responsibilities by contacting the University's Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX Coordinator, Loyola Hall, Suite 140, 425 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95050, bguthrie@scu.edu, (408) 554-3043, http://www.scu.edu/title-ix. Final Examinations A final examination, if given in a course, must be given on the date and time scheduled by the Office of the Registrar. If the final examination is a take-home examination, it may not be due before the scheduled final examination time or any later than the last day of the examination period. Similarly, other end-of-quarter assignments (papers, projects, for example) may not be due any later than the last day of the examination period. Exceptions to this policy require approval of the department chair and the relevant academic dean. "},"chapter-8/RegistrationPoliciesandRegulations.html":{"url":"chapter-8/RegistrationPoliciesandRegulations.html","title":"Registration Policies and Regulations","keywords":"","body":"Registration Policies and Regulations Enrollment and Registration for Classes Students must be officially registered for all classes in accordance with the regulations, procedures, and dates in the quarterly undergraduate Deadlines & Registration booklet. Registration is subject to full payment of tuition, room and board charges, and other fees associated with enrollment. The University reserves the right to deny registration to any student for reasonable cause. A student's eligibility to register for classes is subject to the clearance of any holds on the student's record for academic, financial, student conduct, or other reasons. Santa Clara students may not be concurrently enrolled at another college or university except for extraordinary reasons with the approval of the Dean of Academic Support Services, located in the Drahmann Center. Students register for classes via University eCampus during the time assigned by the Office of the Registrar. Students who do not complete registration during the initial registration period may do so during the published late registration period for the term. Initial registration for a term or class additions are not accepted after the last day of the late registration period. During the first week of each fall, winter, and spring term, students may add and drop classes in accordance with the procedures established by the Office of the Registrar. During the first, second, third, and fourth weeks of the term, a student may drop a class without receiving a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. From the fifth week to the end of the seventh week of the term, a student may drop a class and receive a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. Students may not drop classes after the last day of the seventh week of the term. Students who do not complete a course and do not drop the class in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in the class. Students who have not earned 44 units, including transfer and test credit, may be subject to administrative withdrawal from upper-division courses. This restriction does not apply to upper-division courses for which a student has demonstrated sufficient proficiency. Students may not sit in a class without formally enrolling in the class. Sitting in a class or obtaining an instructor's signature on an add form does not constitute enrollment. Students who do not attend the first day of a class are subject to administrative cancellation of their enrollment in that class in order to make space available to other students. A student who must miss the first day of a class and wishes to remain in the course should contact the instructor in advance. No student who misses the first day of a class should assume that they have been dropped from the course. Students are responsible for checking the status of their enrollment in all courses prior to the end of the late registration period. Unit Overload Students may enroll for no more than 19 units unless they are in the University Honors Programor School of Engineering, their cumulative grade point average at Santa Clara is at least 3.3, or they have upper-division status and obtain approval from the Drahmann Center. One 2-unit course or two 1-unit courses are not counted as overload units. Students who meet the criteria above will not be permitted to register for more than 25 units without approval of the Dean of Academic Support Services. Students may register for courses that result in overload units only during the late registration period. See the website of the Office of the Registrar for registration schedules. Auditing Courses Students admitted to degree status at Santa Clara may audit one course in addition to their regular course load in a term. A maximum of three courses may be audited during a student's academic career. Permission to audit a course will be given only at the end of the late registration period and only if space is available in the class. No credit is assigned for an audited course, but the successful completion of an audit will be indicated on a student's transcript by the notation \"AUD.\" Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to administrative cancellation of their enrollment in that course. Prior to the end of the late registration period, an instructor may notify the University Registrar to drop first-year students who registered in upper-division courses, to drop students who have not satisfied the prerequisites for the course, or to drop students lacking the instructor permission required for certain courses. Withdrawal from the University Students who wish to withdraw from the University must do so by the last day of classes, and must complete a withdrawal survey, appropriate forms, and an exit interview in the Drahmann Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's registration will be canceled without further academic penalty. Students who leave the University during a quarter without withdrawing in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in all courses in which they were registered and are not eligible for a refund of tuition or other fees. Students who withdraw from the University are responsible for any outstanding financial obligations with the University. Students who used deferred payment plans or student loans during their attendance at the University must clear their financial obligations with the Financial Aid Office and the Bursar's Office. Students who have unpaid bills or other unsettled financial obligations with the University will not be eligible for re-enrollment until they have cleared all such obligations. Withdrawal for Health Reasons Students may experience an illness, injury, or psychological condition that significantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely in their role as students. In these instances, the Policy for Withdrawal for Health Reasons allows time away from the University for treatment and recovery until functioning is restored to a level that will enable the student to return to the University. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the procedures for student withdrawals from the University for reasons of health and/or safety. The University has designated four categories relating to withdrawal. They differ according to who initiates the action, whether it is voluntary or not, and the re-enrollment procedures. The Vice Provost for Student Life or designee, in consultation with the appropriate mental and medical health professionals and other staff as deemed necessary, is responsible for the implementation of this policy as stated in the Student Handbook. Re-enrollment at the University A student who withdrew from the University is eligible to re-enroll without special permission under the following conditions: The student left the University in good academic standing The student has no outstanding financial obligations with the University The student plans to return to the same college or school at the University The student is returning within five years of the date of their withdrawal Students who do not meet the conditions above must seek permission to re-enroll from the Dean of Academic Support Services. Re-enrolling students are subject to degree and curriculum requirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entry. Students wishing to re-enroll must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing of their intent to return using the Returning Student form and should consult with a University advisor in the Drahmann Center to review their academic plans. Students on leave who have attended another college or university are permitted to transfer in only a maximum of 10 units of elective credit and are required to forward to the Office of the Registrar an official transcript of all work completed during their absence. "},"chapter-8/GradingPoliciesandRegulations.html":{"url":"chapter-8/GradingPoliciesandRegulations.html","title":"Grading Policies and Regulations","keywords":"","body":"Grading Policies and Regulations Grading Grades are assigned by the instructor to reflect the quality of a student's work. The University uses the following grades: A: Excellent B: Good C: Adequate D: Barely Passing F: Not Passing P: Pass NP: No Pass The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes, except that the grade of \"A\" may not be modified by a (+) suffix. Grade point values per unit are assigned as follows: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7 B+ = 3.3 B = 3.0 B- = 2.7 C+ = 2.3 C = 2.0 C− = 1.7 D+ = 1.3 D = 1.0 D− = 0.7 F = 0 Unit credit, but not grade point credit, is awarded when the grade of \"P\" is assigned. Unit credit is not awarded when the grade of \"NP\" is assigned. The University also uses the following marks for which no unit credit or grade point value is granted: I: Incomplete N: Continuing work NS: No Show AUD: Audit W: Withdrawn Pass/No Pass (P/NP) A grade of \"P\" signifies that the quality of work done is equivalent to a letter grade of \"C\" or higher, while a grade of \"NP\" denotes work at the level of \"C-\" or lower. A maximum of six courses taken under the pass/no pass option in which the student receives a mark of \"P\" can be used to fulfill the unit requirements for graduation. Some courses are offered only on a pass/no pass basis. If a graded option is not available, a course can satisfy Core, major, and/or minor requirements. The pass/no pass option cannot be requested for a course that satisfies a major, minor or core requirement or a major or minor elective requirement. A student with junior or senior standing and a declared major may choose to take an elective course on a pass/no pass basis. Students may enroll in only one elective course on a pass/no pass basis per quarter. Students may choose the pass/no pass option for a class through the end of the fourth week of classes, but may not change the grading option after that date. Incomplete (I) The mark of \"I\" (incomplete) may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the course instructor within three weeks of the beginning of classes in the next scheduled term (not the student's next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, unless extraordinary circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University Registrar within the original three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quarters after the mark of \"I\" was assigned, excluding summer session. An incomplete that has not been completed within the specified deadline or has not received an approved extension will be converted to a grade of \"F.\" Continuing Work (N) The mark of \"N\" (continuing work) may be assigned by an instructor when course requirements span more than one term. When the course requirements are completed, the instructor assigns a standard grade. A student may not graduate and receive a degree with a mark of \"N\" on their academic record. No Show (NS) The mark of \"NS\" (no show) may be assigned by an instructor when a student never attends a class and does not drop the class. A mark of \"NS\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark after it is assigned by the instructor. A mark of \"NS\" is included in the student's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mark of \"NS\" in a class. Audit (AUD) The mark of \"AUD\" is assigned when a student enrolls in a class on an audit basis. A mark of \"AUD\" cannot be changed to any other grade. Withdrawn (W) The mark of \"W\" is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements for dropping a class or withdrawing from the University. A mark of \"W\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark. A mark of \"W\" is included in the student's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. Grade Point Average A student's grade point average is determined by multiplying each grade point value by the number of quarter units assigned to the course, adding these grade point units from all courses taken, and dividing this sum by the total number of quarter units for which letter grades were reported. Grade reports are posted at the end of each quarter and indicate both the grade point average earned by the student during the quarter and the cumulative grade point average earned by the student for all courses completed to that point. Grades earned in courses in SCU-operated or SCU-affiliated study abroad or domestic study programs are included in the calculation of a student's grade point average. Grades earned in courses at other institutions accepted for transfer credit are not included in the calculation of a student's grade point average. Evaluation of Progress Grades are available at the end of the term via University eCampus. Faculty members are expected to apprise students of their course progress at reasonable intervals. Some measurements of progress should take place in time to enable students to make reasonable decisions with respect to the fourth-week and seventh-week withdrawal deadlines. Change of Grade Only the faculty member responsible for a course may assign grades. All grades become final when they have been assigned and reported to the Office of the Registrar. A faculty member may report a correction of a final grade to the Office of the Registrar only if a clerical or procedural error was made in assigning, transmitting, or recording the original grade. A grade may not be changed as a result of re-evaluation, re-examination, or the submission of additional work after the term ends. Any grade change must have the approval of the department chair and the associate dean of the student's school or college. No grade may be changed after one year. Student Appeals of Grades Grades are not negotiable. There should be no questioning of a faculty member's academic judgment on a grade. In registering for a class, students implicitly agree to allow the faculty member to make a qualitative judgment of their command of the subject matter, which will be expressed as a letter grade. Any questioning or appeal of a grade should therefore be limited to procedure, e.g., to computational errors or failures to follow grading policies set forth in the syllabi. Any system of grade-appeal should protect the rights of faculty members as well as the rights of students. The results of any system of grade-appeal should not be binding upon the faculty member. Any decision to initiate a change of grade should remain the faculty member's. Any procedural complaint regarding a change of grade must be initiated within four weeks of the beginning of the next scheduled term, not including summer sessions. A student with a complaint must first discuss the matter with the faculty member. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student may then take the matter to the chairperson of the department involved. The chairperson will discuss the case with the faculty member and may recommend that the faculty member review the grade. Upon the request of the student, the dean will proceed in similar fashion. Should the student request it, the dean will pass the matter on to the provost. This process of review gives the chairperson, dean, and provost the right to discuss the matter with the faculty member, and if they think it appropriate, request that the faculty member review the grade. Any recommendations made will not be binding upon the faculty member against whom the complaint is lodged. The decision to change a grade remains with the faculty member. "},"chapter-8/AcademicStandingandStudentClassification.html":{"url":"chapter-8/AcademicStandingandStudentClassification.html","title":"Academic Standing and Student Classification","keywords":"","body":"Academic Standing and Student Classification Student Classification The University only admits students to its undergraduate degree programs on a full-time basis. Students who have not been admitted to degree status at the University may register for classes in accordance with the policies and regulations outlined in the section of this chapter covering non-degree students. The classification of students is determined by the number of quarter units completed with passing grades. Lower-division students are considered first-year if they have completed fewer than 44 units and sophomores when they have completed at least 44 units but fewer than 88 units. Upper-division students are considered juniors when they have completed at least 88 units but fewer than 131 units and seniors when they have completed at least 131 units. If a student is enrolled for 12 or more units in a given term, they have full-time status for academic purposes. Students enrolled for fewer than 12 units have part-time status for that term and may not qualify for all University activities and benefits, such as eligibility for financial aid, on-campus housing, and intercollegiate athletic competition. Continuing enrollment at the University in part-time status requires approval by the Dean of Academic Support Services. Academic Standing To be in good academic standing at the University, a student must normally be enrolled for 12 or more units, must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara, and must have completed at least a minimum number of units as specified below. Failure to meet these requirements may result in academic probation or disqualification from future registration at the University. Students in their last term of enrollment before completing a degree may be classified, for academic standing purposes, as a full-time student when enrolled for less than 12 units. Academic Probation Students at Santa Clara are subject to academic probation if their cumulative grade point average is lower than 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara. Students are also subject to academic probation if they fail to make satisfactory progress toward their degree as defined below: Completing at least 36 quarter units in the previous three quarters of residency or Completing at least 36 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing at least 76 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing at least 115 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing at least 160 quarter units by the end of the 12th quarter of residency Academic Disqualification Students are subject to disqualification from further registration at the University for any of the following reasons: Remaining on academic probation for more than two quarters without improvement Failing to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 or Completing fewer than 30 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing fewer than 64 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 100 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 150 quarter units by the end of the 12th quarter of residency Reinstatement to the University Reinstatement to the University after disqualification is rarely permitted and requires favorable action by the Dean of Academic Support Services in consultation with the dean of the student's college or school. Requests for reinstatement are made to the Dean of Academic Support Services and must include a description of any activities during the period of disqualification that would indicate that an improved academic performance can be expected in the future. A student generally may not apply for reinstatement within a year of the date of disqualification. The request for reinstatement will be considered only if the student's academic deficiencies can be corrected within a reasonable time. "},"chapter-8/AcademicCreditEvaluation.html":{"url":"chapter-8/AcademicCreditEvaluation.html","title":"Academic Credit Evaluation","keywords":"","body":"Academic Credit Evaluation Santa Clara awards credit based on the Advanced Placement Program, the International Baccalaureate Program, University of Cambridge International Examinations, courses completed at other accredited colleges and universities, and courses completed in University-approved study abroad and domestic study programs using the criteria outlined herein. Students are allowed to transfer in a maximum of one-half of the total quarter units required to graduate in their specific program. Students may not take a SCU course for credit for which they have already received transfer credit. Santa Clara University does not allow students to receive duplicate credit for courses. You can either receive test credit for a course or take the course at SCU, but not both. Credit is not awarded for the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). Advanced Placement (AP) Credit Santa Clara participates in the Advanced Placement Program to recognize college-level academic achievement prior to matriculation and to encourage students to pursue advanced studies in their areas of interest. Credit or placement is determined by the appropriate department based on review of the student's Advanced Placement scores, sometimes in the context of supplemental departmental examinations. Note: students who are awarded credit for exams taken in Spring 2020 that covered a shortened curriculum and who wish to enroll in the next level course at Santa Clara University should consult with their department and/or advisor to ensure they will not be at a disadvantage in that field of study. The following chart indicates the subject examination, required scores, and Santa Clara credit granted through the Advanced Placement tests. Courses waived will always satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum. Courses waived by AP test scores, when relevant, may satisfy Second Language, Mathematics, Natural Science, and Social Science requirements in the Core Curriculum.

University of Cambridge International Examinations Santa Clara University accepts selected University of Cambridge International Advanced (A) Level examinations with letter grades of A (a) or B (b). Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Ordinary (O) Level examinations are not awarded credit. Final decisions on academic credit for A Level subject examinations are made individually by the appropriate academic department in consultation with the University Registrar. Courses waived will satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum. Transfer Credit and the Core Curriculum All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; Religion, Theology & Culture; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for Social Justice; and Pathways. For all other Core requirements, it is possible for students to earn credit by taking Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, or by completing college-level courses prior to enrolling at Santa Clara. Transfer credit earned from courses completed before enrollment at Santa Clara is governed by two sets of rules: One for students admitted as first-year students and another for transfer students. Students admitted as first-year students must satisfy Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2, and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3 with courses completed at Santa Clara University. In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 before their first quarter at Santa Clara. Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in the required sequence. In addition, students must complete their Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 at Santa Clara University if the student does not have transfer credit to fulfill both courses in the sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, must complete two courses from the Religion, Theology & Culture sequence in any order. Transfer students must declare their Pathways by the end of their third quarter at SCU. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units must take four courses (minimum of 16 units) to fulfill the Pathways requirement. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) to fulfill the Pathways requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) to fulfill the Pathways requirement. More detailed Pathway guidelines are available on the Pathways website. Transfer credit earned from courses completed after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill Core Curriculum or other requirements. A maximum number of 10 quarter units of free elective transfer credit can be awarded. Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the chapter(s) relevant to their school or college for additional relevant information. Units Taken at Other Institutions Credit is awarded for coursework completed at other accredited colleges and universities subject to certain limitations. Courses are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses of a trade or technical nature do not transfer. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer. Transfer students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities prior to matriculation at Santa Clara for no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for the specific Santa Clara degree. After enrolling at Santa Clara, students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities for no more than 10 quarter units of free electives, subject to the limitation that no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for a Santa Clara degree can be earned at another institution. Transfer credit earned after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill undergraduate Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or program requirements. Transfer credit for all coursework completed at other colleges and universities requires approval from the Office of the Registrar and the chair of the department offering the equivalent Santa Clara course. The student must have earned a grade of \"C\" or better in a course for transfer credit to be granted. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not accepted as transfer credit (Note below, the exception being made to Spring 2020 term course work). Grades for units earned at other institutions are not included in a student's Santa Clara academic history or in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. (Note: Exception for Spring 2020 term: Regarding transfer credits for work completed in Spring Term 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, course work receiving a grade of Pass or Credit is transferable. We encourage students continuing on in those subject areas to consult with their departments and advisors to ensure they are adequately prepared for the next level courses.) Study Abroad and Domestic Study Programs Qualified undergraduate students may apply to study abroad for a quarter, semester, or summer term in a country and academic environment that will enrich their overall college experience, contribute positively to the life of the University, and engender responsible participation in a global, multicultural society. Units and grades earned through study abroad programs and domestic off-campus study programs that have been approved through regular University processes are included on the Santa Clara University transcript and may be used to fulfill major, minor, and Core requirements with prior approval by the department chair or Core director. Grades earned in approved study abroad and domestic off-campus study programs are included in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. The third-level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology & Culture cannot be fulfilled with a study abroad course. Units earned for coursework in study abroad and domestic off-campus study programs not approved by the University through the regular application process are subject to the policies governing transfer credit and may not fulfill major, minor, or Core requirements. See the sections on transfer credit earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 7.

"},"chapter-8/AcademicIntegrity.html":{"url":"chapter-8/AcademicIntegrity.html","title":"Academic Integrity","keywords":"","body":"Academic Integrity The University is committed to academic excellence and integrity. Santa Clara University Students affirm the following commitment to academic integrity: I am committed to being a person of integrity. I pledge, as a member of the Santa Clara University community, to abide by and uphold the standards of academic integrity contained in the Student Conduct Code. Students are expected to do their own work and to cite any sources they use. Academic dishonesty may include but is not limited to plagiarism (i.e., representing the work or ideas of others as one's own without giving proper acknowledgment), cheating (e.g., copying the work of another person, falsifying laboratory data, sabotaging the work of others), and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context. A student who is guilty of a dishonest act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to and including dismissal from the University, as a result of the student judicial process as described in the Student Handbook and the Academic Integrity Protocol. A student who violates copyright laws, including those covering the copying of software programs, or who knowingly alters official academic records from this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action. Academic Integrity Protocol Allegations within the Context of a Course These procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University community with a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind as described in the Student Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, or the use of prohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allegation of student academic dishonesty. The following describes procedures for resolution by due process. If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolution begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs the student of the suspicion. If the instructor judges on the basis of available evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severity of the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, \"F\" on the particular assignment, or \"F\" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair and the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the matter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom. Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor's decision, the student will contact the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or designate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department. The department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only role is to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty member from a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the Office of Student Life will arrange for the participation of the student panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair. The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a particular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon a belief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evaluation and therefore will not review the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student. After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of the recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student and the Office of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course. Decisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are intended to be confidential. If the student wishes to withdraw from the course, the instructor's approval is required for the withdrawal process. The instructor may refuse to approve of the withdrawal and may assign an appropriate grade. University Judicial Process When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files. If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the severity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integrity violations. Allegations Outside a Course If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved.

Information presented in compliance with this act is made available to assist current and potential students and employees in making informed decisions regarding their attendance or employment at the University. The daily crime and fire log and other information about the law are available on the Campus Safety website. It is the policy of Santa Clara University that the campus community will be informed on a timely basis of all reports of crime and other information affecting the security of our campus and the personal safety of our students, faculty, staff, and guests. Communication by the University to Undergraduate Students The University will communicate with undergraduate students through a variety of formats. Information that is sent to undergraduate students from the University via their campus mailbox, local address, or their Santa Clara email address is considered official communication and should be treated as such. Students are asked to check their campus mailbox and their Santa Clara email account on a daily basis, and are responsible for reading and responding to the information they receive from the University. The University urges undergraduate students to use their Santa Clara email address as their primary email; students who will not be checking that address regularly should forward their email to their preferred email account. Consensual Relations Between Employees and Students In addition to prohibiting sexual harassment under the Policy on Discrimination, Harassmend Sexual Misconduct, the University prohibits any consensual dating, romantic, or sexual relationship between an employee and a student over whom that employee has any instructional, supervisory, advising, or evaluative responsibility. Such a relationship is fraught with problems, including the potential for exploitation, favoritism, and conflict of interest. The appearance of impropriety or unfairness may also adversely affect the learning and work environment for other students and employees. This policy applies to faculty, staff, and student employees. Employees who violate this policy are subject to sanctions for misconduct under the policies of the Faculty Handbook, Staff Policy Manual, or Student Employment Handbook, as appropriate to their employment status. Employees or students with questions about this policy should contact the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX or the Department of Human Resources. Drug-free Workplace and School Program It is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University's activities. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace even if it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct. The unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and campus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clara premises where the activities of the University are conducted. Violations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. The program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and students. New staff employees are given a copy at New Employee Orientation. New faculty employees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation. The program is reviewed at least biennially by the Office of Student Life and the Department of Human Resources. Notice of Student Rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) is the federal law that protects the confidentiality of the educational records of students maintained by the University and affords students certain rights with respect to those records. A student is any person who attends or has attended a class at the University, which includes courses taken through videoconference, satellite, internet, or other electronic and telecommunication technologies. Students' rights under FERPA include: The right to inspect and review educational records Students have the right to inspect and review their education records. Students should submit a written request to the Office of the Registrar that specifies what records the students would like to inspect and review. Within 45 days of receipt of the request, the Office of the Registrar will make arrangements for access and will notify students of the time and place where the records may be reviewed. The right to seek amendment to educational records Students have the right to request the amendment of their educational records to ensure that those records are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of students' privacy or other rights. Students who wish to seek an amendment to a record should write the University Registrar, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it should be changed. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested, the University will notify students in writing of the decision and their right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to students when notified of the right to a hearing. The right to consent to disclosure of educational records Students have the right to consent to the disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in their educational records. In some instances, the University may disclose personally identifiable information from a student's educational record without the student's consent. One such instance is to a school official who has a legitimate educational interest in the record. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position; a person elected to the Board of Trustees; or a person or entity under contract with the University who has been designated a school official by the University and is performing specific duties for the University that require a legitimate educational interest. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review any educational records in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. The University is authorized under provisions of FERPA to release directory information without the student's prior consent, unless a student explicitly requests in writing that the University not do so and keep directory information confidential. Directory information is designated as follows: Name Address: Campus post office box, local, and permanent addresses (residence hall and room numbers are not disclosed) Telephone number Email address Photograph Date and place of birth Major field of study Classification level/academic standing Dates of attendance (defined as academic year or quarter) Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Weight and height of members of athletic teams Degrees (including expected or actual degree date), honors and awards received, and dates Most recent educational agency or institution attended Students may submit a Request to Prevent Disclosure of Directory Information form to the Office of the Registrar, which directs the University not to disclose directory information. Once filed, the nondisclosure remains in effect until the beginning of the next academic year or a shorter period if designated by a student. Graduating students must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing to remove the nondisclosure from their record. Former or current borrowers of funds from any Title IV student loan program should note carefully that nondisclosure will not prevent the University from releasing information pertinent to employment, enrollment status, current address, and loan account status to a school lender, subsequent holder, guarantee agency, the United States Department of Education, or an authorized agent. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Students have the right to file a complaint with the United States Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Written complaints should be directed to the U.S. Department of Education, Student Privacy Policy Office, 400 Maryland Ave., SW, Washington D.C. 20202-8520.

Children of eligible employees may apply for undergraduate admission to one of the participating Jesuit colleges and universities and, if accepted, are eligible for consideration of a full tuition scholarship subject to the terms and conditions set by the accepting institution. FACHEX scholarships are not a guaranteed award. They must be offered by the accepting institution. Each member institution is obligated to maintain a balance between students sent on the exchange (exports) and students received on the exchange (imports). FACHEX eligibility does not qualify a dependent child for admission, nor does an offer of admission to a participating Jesuit university guarantee a FACHEX Award. Full-time faculty and staff with at least three years of continuous service are eligible to apply for their dependent children. Tuition Exchange Awards The Tuition Exchange program is a national undergraduate scholarship exchange program for institutions of higher education. Children of eligible employees may apply for undergraduate admission to one of the participating institutions and, if accepted, are eligible for consideration of a tuition scholarship subject to the terms and conditions set by the accepting institution. Tuition Exchange, Inc. is a partnership of over 675 colleges and universities offering competitive tuition exchange scholarships. Tuition Exchange scholarships are not a guaranteed award. They must be offered by the accepting institution. Each member institution is obligated to maintain a balance between students sent on the exchange (exports) and students received on the exchange (imports). Eligible employees who have at least three years of continuous service with the University are eligible to apply for Tuition Exchange Awards for their dependent children. Federal and California Grants Federal Pell Grant The Federal Pell Grant is a need-based grant awarded to students in accordance with eligibility requirements set by the United States Department of Education. The maximum amount of a Federal Pell Grant is set in the funding legislation adopted by Congress. The Federal Pell Grant can be used for tuition, fees, and living expenses. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for a Federal Pell Grant. Note: The Federal Pell Grant, as with all federal grants, is subject to federal funding. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) is a need-based grant available to students with the most exceptional need who have not yet received a bachelor's degree. Priority is given to students who are eligible for the Federal Pell Grant and then to other undergraduate students with the greatest demonstrated need. Note: FSEOG, as with all federal grants, is subject to federal funding. Federal Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant program provides grants of up to $4,000 per academic year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families. Eligible students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.25. If the student fails to complete the required service obligation, all amounts of TEACH grants received will be converted to an unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan. Note: The TEACH Grant, as with all federal grants, is subject to federal funding. Cal Grants (for California residents only) Cal Grants are administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC). The Cal Grant program provides state-funded awards to California residents based on both academic achievement and financial need. Cal Grant A provides funds for partial tuition and fees. Cal Grant B recipients receive a subsistence award the first year and receive a subsistence award and tuition award in subsequent years. Note: Cal Grants, as with all state grants, are subject to state funding. Other Grants and Scholarships Army ROTC Scholarships Scholarships are awarded to undergraduate students through the Army Reserve Officers Training Program (ROTC). Two-year, three-year, and four-year scholarships are awarded under the program to eligible ROTC students. The ROTC scholarships may cover full tuition from funds provided by the Army and may cover standard on-campus room and board charges from a University grant. Recipients may also receive a tax-free stipend during the academic year and an allowance for books and other educational items. Students who accept Army ROTC scholarships incur a military obligation that can be fulfilled by serving part-time in the Army National Guard or Army Reserve, or by serving full time on Army active duty. Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress as defined by Santa Clara University. Note: This scholarship may not exceed the amount of tuition; part-time attendance may cause a reduction to this scholarship. Private Scholarships Students receiving private scholarships must notify the Financial Aid Office if they are receiving any other form of financial aid. Private scholarship checks should be sent by the awarding organization to the Financial Aid Office to ensure appropriate and timely processing. The Financial Aid Office will coordinate private scholarships with other financial aid awards in accordance with applicable federal, state, and University regulations. Student Employment Campus Employment Part-time jobs for undergraduate students are available in many offices and departments on campus. Campus job listings are maintained by the Student Employment Office. Students earn an hourly wage at least at the current minimum wage rate for the state of California and may be paid at a higher rate depending on the type of work or skills required. Federal Work-Study Program The Federal Work-Study Program is a need-based student employment program under which students can work up to 19 hours per week on campus or through an approved off-campus site. Students earn an hourly wage at least at the current minimum wage rate for the state of California and may be paid at a higher rate depending on the type of work or skills required. Students receive a paycheck each period and can use the money for educational or living expenses. Earnings under the program are taxable. Loans William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans are federally funded low-interest loans provided to undergraduate students and administered by the United States Department of Education. Under the Federal Direct Loan program, a student may borrow funds for educationally related expenses and defer repayment until six months after graduation or when the enrollment status drops below half-time (e.g., less than 6 units). If an undergraduate is an independent student or a dependent student whose parents were denied for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, the student can borrow additional funds through the Federal Direct Loan program based on their academic grade level. To receive a subsidized Federal Direct Loan, a student must have financial need. Interest is not charged on a subsidized Federal Direct Loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time. Eligibility for unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans is determined after eligibility for subsidized Federal Direct Loans is decided. Interest accrues on unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans during all periods, including while the student is enrolled in school and during any grace or deferment periods. Federal Direct PLUS Loan A parent or stepparent of a dependent student may apply for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program to help cover the cost of educational expenses. To be eligible for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, a student must be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen and must be enrolled at least half-time. A parent may borrow up to the cost of attendance minus all other financial aid for each undergraduate child. An origination fee is deducted from the disbursement of the loan. Financial Aid Eligibility Enrollment Status and Financial Aid Eligibility Undergraduate students receiving financial aid must meet general University eligibility requirements and any applicable eligibility criteria associated with specific federal, state, or University aid programs from which they are receiving support. Financial aid recipients generally must be enrolled as full-time students in a minimum of 12 units each quarter in which aid is received, must be making satisfactory progress toward a degree, and must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. Financial aid awards to students who drop below full-time status (e.g., less than 12 units) will be adjusted unless certification for continuing eligibility is granted by the Financial Aid Office. Eligibility for institutional financial aid is limited to a maximum of 12 consecutive academic quarters of undergraduate study. Financial aid awards will cease after the 12 quarters of enrollment in a postsecondary institution unless certification for continuing eligibility is granted by the Financial Aid Office. Specific financial aid awards may have additional requirements for continuing eligibility. The U.S. Department of Education has basic eligibility requirements for financial aid, which must be met and maintained in order for a student to be eligible to receive aid. These requirements apply to all federal, state, and Santa Clara University--funded aid. A student must \"be enrolled in an eligible program as a regular student seeking a degree or certificate.\" Students cannot be awarded aid for classes that do not count toward their degree, certificate, or other recognized credential. In short, students are only eligible for federal, state, and University-funded aid when taking classes that are required to complete a degree (either major or minor). Once those degree requirements have been met and a student is eligible to graduate, he or she is no longer entitled to receive aid. This holds true even if the student has been here fewer than 12 academic quarters. Students who are able to graduate because they have completed all of their degree requirements but decide to enroll for an additional term are not eligible to receive federal, state, or University-funded aid for the additional term. Students who believe that they may be impacted by the U.S Department of Education regulations should reach out to a financial aid counselor to discuss their particular circumstances. The University has developed responses to some frequently asked questions. Academic Standing and Satisfactory Progress Requirements All financial aid recipients must maintain good academic standing and be making satisfactory progress toward a degree according to the University standards and applicable federal and state regulations. Students are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress each quarter. Qualitatively Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. Note: Some Santa Clara University aid programs require a higher cumulative grade point average than the federal minimum requirement. Quantitatively Students must maintain a cumulative 67 percent completion rate for all units attempted toward their academic programs. Maximum Attempted Units Allowed Students must complete the requirements for their academic programs within 150 percent of the minimum units required to complete their academic programs. Units attempted also include all units transferred into Santa Clara University from prior institutions that can be used to satisfy students' academic program requirements. Students who have reached their maximum attempted units allowed are ineligible for additional financial aid. Students may appeal for financial aid probation status if they feel their circumstances warrant an exception to this standard. Unit Requirements All financial aid recipients must register for and maintain a full course load of 12 units or more per quarter, if the aid was awarded on this basis. Students who drop below 12 units may see their financial aid adjusted. Full-time and part-time status is defined as follows: Full-time: 12 or more units Three-fourths time: 9 to 11 units Half-time: 6 to 8 units Less than half-time: fewer than 6 units Course Incompletes, Withdrawal, Failures, and/or Repetitions Incompletes (I), Withdrawals (W), Failures (F), and/or repeated courses will adversely affect a student's completion rate. Students must complete the minimum number of units to fulfill federal, state, and University requirements. Completion rates are calculated cumulatively and will include all quarters that the student was enrolled, whether or not the student received financial aid. Students who wish to withdraw from Santa Clara University during a quarter must complete a withdrawal form and an exit interview in the Drahmann Advising and Learning Resource Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's registration will be canceled without academic penalty. A withdrawal notation (W) will be assigned for each course from which the student withdraws after the fourth week of the quarter. Students who leave Santa Clara University during a quarter without formally withdrawing are subject to failing grades in all courses in which they were registered and are ineligible for refund of tuition. IMPORTANT: Any student leaving Santa Clara University at the conclusion of any quarter should also complete the standard withdrawal process. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than C minus (C-). In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the calculation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and performance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion. Evaluation All students enrolled at Santa Clara University are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress at the end of each quarter after the Office of Registrar has released official grades. Appeal Process There may be extenuating circumstances encountered by a student that affect his/her ability to be academically successful during an enrollment period. These circumstances include personal injury or illness that occurs during an enrollment period; death of an immediate family member or legal guardian during an enrollment period; or other documented circumstances that were unexpected in nature and beyond control of the student. In these cases, cumulative grade point average or completion rate may decline resulting in the student not meeting the minimum qualitative and quantitative standards previously described. If the student wishes to appeal the suspension from financial aid eligibility, a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal form must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office. If the appeal is approved, s/he will be placed on financial aid probation (separate from academic probation). Students will be notified of the appeal results in writing. Loss of Eligibility A student who has lost eligibility to participate in federal, state, and University aid programs for reasons of academic progress can regain that eligibility only by enrolling at Santa Clara University at his/her own expense. The mere passage of time will not restore eligibility to a student who has lost eligibility for failure to make satisfactory academic progress. Students who have been dismissed from Santa Clara University for academic reasons, but who are subsequently readmitted are not automatically eligible to participate in federal, state, or institutional aid programs and will be placed on financial aid warning. Re-admission decisions are separate from funding decisions. Regaining Eligibility Students who fail to meet satisfactory academic progress and who choose to enroll without financial aid may request a review of their academic record after any term in which they are enrolled without the receipt of financial aid. If the standards are met at the time of review, eligibility may be regained for subsequent terms of enrollment in the academic year. Other Program Eligibility Study Abroad and Global Programs Santa Clara University students participating in study abroad and domestic public sector study programs operated by or affiliated with the University are eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid and tuition remission as well as federal and state aid consistent with the policies and practices applicable to students enrolled for on-campus classes. Tuition and room and board rates associated with the specific program will be factored into the determination of the financial aid award consistent with applicable policies and practices. The total amount of tuition remission for the academic year cannot exceed the annual tuition rate for that year. Students with private scholarships should contact the donor for prior approval to use funds for study abroad or domestic study programs. Students from other colleges and universities enrolled in Santa Clara University study abroad programs are not eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid. Veterans and Veterans' Dependents Assistance Santa Clara University has been certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 percent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill®), Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®), and Yellow Ribbon. Individuals interested in attending under any of the veteran assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar. GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill. Cancellation of Financial Aid and Return of Funds Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are subject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal financial aid funds governed under Title IV other than those earned under the college work-study program. Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to state or University financial aid programs or to the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received Federal Title IV assistance: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans) Subsidized Federal Direct Loans Federal Direct PLUS Loans Federal Pell Grants for which a return is required Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants for which a return is required TEACH Grants for which a return is required Iraq and Afghanistan Grants for which a return is required Student Verification of Information The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students and their families submit as a basis for the award of aid. Each year, a percentage of students receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the information on which their awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid and to verify the attendance of other children in college. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds. Billing and Payment Procedures Student Accounts and Billing Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures. Students may designate a third party (e.g., parent, family member, spouse) to be an authorized payer for the purpose of reviewing student account/billing information and remitting payments on the student's behalf. However, it is ultimately the student's responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the published deadlines. Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through University eCampus. Billing notification will be sent to the student's assigned SCU gmail account and to the email address of any authorized payer. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remittance. Information on a student's account cannot be provided to any third party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University. Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees associated with their enrollment status by the published term payment deadline, regardless of receiving a billing statement. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to prepay for their enrollment. Registered students who do not withdraw formally from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their student account as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees. Payment Methods Santa Clara University offers a variety of payment methods to students and their parents to assist with their financial obligations. Payment by Electronic Check A student or authorized payer may make online payments by authorizing a fund transfer directly from their personal checking or savings account through a third-party website accessible via the University eCampus system. The payer is able to make electronic check payments online without incurring a transaction fee. Payment by Mail Payments for student account charges are accepted by mail utilizing the University's cash management service lockbox. The payer should download a copy of the student's billing statement, enclose it with a personal or cashier's check payable to \"Santa Clara University,\" and mail both items to: SCU Payment Processing, P.O. Box 550, Santa Clara, CA 95052-0550. Payment in Person Payments for student account charges may be made in person by cash or check only at the OneStop Office located in the Admissions and Enrollment Services Building. The Office is not able to accept any electronic form of payment. However, there are computer kiosks located in the Admissions and Enrollment Services Building for the convenience of students and their payers who wish to make electronic payments. The University does not accept credit cards as payment for student account charges. Extended Payment Options For students and their families wishing to spread payments over a period of time, the University offers term payment plans, which are available through the online billing system via eCampus or authorized payer login. There is a modest, non refundable, fixed fee to enroll in these plans each term, but no interest is charged during the payment term. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar's Office website. Delinquent Payments If all charges on a student's account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student's account and a hold will be placed on the student's account. A hold on a student's account prevents the release of diplomas or certificates, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default in accordance with California state law. Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recovering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and reasonable attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University. Students with prior delinquent student accounts may be required to prepay for future enrollment. Refunds and Payment Policies Students may be eligible for a refund if they have a credit balance on their account. Refunds are processed after the add/drop period of each term/semester. Payment received by personal check will have a 14 calendar day hold before a refund can be issued. A 7 calendar day hold applies for electronic check payments. Refunds will not be processed for any overpayment on the account unless the student has completely withdrawn or dropped units causing a credit balance. The University has partnered with A.W.G. Dewar, Inc. to provide a low-cost, tuition insurance protection plan. This plan protects students and their families against financial loss due to an unexpected complete withdrawal from the University, for diagnosed medical or mental health reasons. Santa Clara will charge the tuition insurance plan quarterly to the student's account. Students can choose to opt-out of the tuition insurance plan by completing a waiver on the Dewar website prior to the first day of the academic quarter. Information on the waiver and tuition insurance plan is available on the Bursar's Office website. Billing Disputes If a student wishes to dispute any charge on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar's Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar's Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the disputed charge appeared. Communication can be made by telephone, but doing so will not preserve the student's rights. Communication should include the student's name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress. However, all other charges need to be paid by the payment deadlines. If the disputed amount is deemed to be invalid, then an adjustment will be made on the student's account. If the amount in question is found to be valid, payment must be submitted to the Bursar's Office immediately upon notification.

The University provides resources and reporting options to students, faculty, and staff to address concerns related to gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct prohibited by Title IX and University policy, and, through training and education, works to prevent its occurrence. The University seeks to provide a consistent, caring, and timely response when sexual and gender-based misconduct occurs within the University community. When the University becomes aware of allegations of sexual misconduct, it will take prompt and effective action. This action may include an initial assessment of safety and well-being, implementing interim remedies at no cost to the complainant for protection and support, discussing how the complainant wishes to proceed, initiating an investigation, and identifying appropriate avenues for resolution. The University's response will be overseen by the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX. The University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy applies to all students, faculty, and staff, and includes any individual regularly or temporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or serving in an official capacity at Santa Clara University (including volunteers and contractors). The policy applies to both on-campus and off-campus conduct and to online actions that have a potential or actual adverse impact on any member of the University community, or which substantially interferes with a person's ability to participate in University activities, or which could affect a substantial University interest or its educational mission. For more information about reporting, response, and adjudication, please see the University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy or contact the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, www.scu.edu/title-ix. NOTE: The Department of Education issued new Title IX regulations to be effective August 14, 2020. The University will update relevant policies and procedures including the Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy to ensure compliance and will post revisions online at www.scu.edu/title-ix. What Constitutes Consent The University adheres to California's definition of affirmative consent for sexual activity. Affirmative consent means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Since individuals may experience the same interaction in different ways, it is the responsibility of each party to determine that the other has consented before engaging in the activity. For consent to be valid, there must be a clear expression in words or actions that the other individual consented to that specific sexual conduct. Reasonable reciprocation can be implied. For example, if someone kisses you, you can kiss them back (if you want to) without the need to explicitly obtain their consent to being kissed back. Consent can also be withdrawn once given, as long as the withdrawal is reasonably and clearly communicated. If consent is withdrawn, that sexual activity should cease. Consent to some sexual contact (such as kissing or fondling) cannot be presumed to be consent for other sexual activity (such as intercourse). A current or previous intimate relationship is not sufficient to constitute consent. Consent is based on the totality of the circumstances evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances, including the context in which the alleged incident occurred and any similar previous patterns that may be evidenced. The question of whether the responding party should have known of the reporting party's incapacity is an objective inquiry as to what a reasonable person, exercising sober judgment, would have known, in the same or similar circumstances. Consent is not voluntary if forced or coerced. Force is the use of physical violence or physical imposition to gain sexual access. Force also includes threats, intimidation (implied threats), and coercion that is intended to overcome resistance or produce consent Coercion is unreasonable pressure for sexual activity. Sexual activity that is forced is, by definition, non-consensual, but non-consensual sexual activity is not necessarily forced. Silence or the absence of resistance alone is not consent. Consent is not demonstrated by the absence of resistance. While resistance is not required or necessary, it is a clear demonstration of non-consent. A person cannot consent if they are unable to understand what is happening, asleep, or unconscious for any reason. A person violates this policy if they engage in sexual activity with someone they know to be, or should know to be, physically or mentally incapacitated. This policy also covers a person whose incapacity results from a temporary or permanent physical or mental health condition, involuntary physical restraint, or the consumption of incapacitating drug or alcohol. Incapacitation occurs when someone cannot make rational, reasonable decisions because they lack the capacity to give knowing/informed consent (e.g. to understand the \"who, what, when, where, why, or how\" of their sexual interaction). Incapacitation is determined through consideration of all relevant indicators of an individual's state and is not synonymous with (under the) influence, impairment, intoxication, inebriation, blackout, or being drunk. It is not an excuse that the responding party was intoxicated and, therefore, did not realize the incapacity of the reporting party. Reporting Options There are confidential and non-confidential reporting options available. Confidential Resources include on and off campus mental counselors, health service providers, local rape crisis counselors, domestic violence resources, and members of the clergy and chaplains. Confidential on-campus resources include CAPS, Cowell Center, 408-554-4501; Wellness Center, 862 Market Street, 408-554-4409; and members of the clergy or chaplains. Confidential means that what a reporting party shares will not be communicated with anyone else unless except in extreme cases of immediacy of threat or abuse of a minor. Reporting to Law Enforcement For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime of sexual violence, including sexual assault, domestic/dating violence (intimate partner violence), and stalking students, contact the Santa Clara Police Department, dial 911, or contact Campus Safety Services at 408-554-4444. Reporting to the University To report an incident to the University, students may: Report directly to the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX Report online at https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/reporting/ Report anonymously using EthicsPoint at www.scu.edu/hr/quick-links/ethicspoint/ Other campus non-confidential reporting options: Students may report incidents and seek support from other University officials, including: The Office of Student Life, The Office of Residence Life (including Community Facilitators, Resident Directors, Assistant Resident Directors, Neighborhood Representatives, and Assistant Area Coordinators), Spirituality Facilitators, The Office of Housing, Athletics and Recreation, The Center for Student Leadership, The Drahmann Center, Office of Accessible Education (OAE), The Career Center, and Campus Ministry. These University resources are required to report incidents to the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, who will oversee the investigation and resolution process. At the time a report is made, a complainant does not have to decide whether or not to request or participate in an investigation or University resolution process.
