Center for Student Involvement
==============================

The Center for Student Involvement is invested in accompanying undergraduate students to find their place by providing a space to cultivate personal values, opinions, and beliefs. We inspire the development of courage, character, and understanding of others through:

-   Empowering Broncos to have pride and find fulfillment through discovery, individuality, and teamwork

-   Using experiences and relationships to build genuine engagement, rooted in Jesuit ideals that encompass integrity, reflection, and compassion

-   Providing guidance to individuals in the development of their skills, knowledge, and self-awareness in order to become responsible contributors to society
