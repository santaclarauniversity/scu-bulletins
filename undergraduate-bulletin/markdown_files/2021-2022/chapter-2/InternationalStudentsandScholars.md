International Students and Scholars
===================================

International Students and Scholars (ISS) is part of the Global Engagement unit, which provides leadership, strategic planning, coordination, and resources for expanding intercultural and international initiatives across campus to enhance global diversity.

The ISS team provides international students with academic, intercultural and immigration advising on F-1 and J-1 visas, as well as career integration and advising for academic internships and post-graduation employment. ISS also supports international students in other visa categories who wish to change their status to F-1, as well as international students who are Global Nomads: U.S. passport holders living abroad.

As soon as international students confirm their attendance at SCU, ISS: a) provides initial documents to help students obtain their visa to attend SCU; b) helps students prepare for travel and arrival to the US; and c) advises students on academic planning, planning for internships, and post-graduation employment.

All international students participate in International Student Welcome (ISW), a robust orientation program for international students that supplements the new student orientation program. Global Engagement and ISS provide regular programming to support international student success. Examples of recent programming include immigration workshops, Employment Bootcamp, the U.S. Cultural Conversations series, the iExchange program, and the international graduation reception.
