The Department of Psychology offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of science in psychology. Psychology is the study of behavior, emotion, and thought using the scientific method. At the undergraduate level, the study of psychology is part of a liberal arts education. A major in psychology lays the groundwork for various careers and advanced studies, including the pursuit of graduate degrees needed for the professional practice of psychology.
