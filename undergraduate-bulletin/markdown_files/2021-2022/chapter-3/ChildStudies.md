Child Studies Program
=====================

*Professor Emerita:* Eleanor W. Willemsen

*Professor:* Barbara M. Burns

*Associate Professor:* Brett J. Solomon (Director)

*Assistant Professor*: Omar Davila, Jr.

*Senior Lecturer:* Elizabeth Day

The Child Studies (CHST) major is designed for undergraduates interested in careers working with children and families in school or community settings. The curriculum encompasses a social-justice, anti-racist, and cultural competence perspective, all constructs that are critical for 21st century child advocates. As a complement to the curriculum, CHST majors work extensively with children and families in local schools and community-based programs. Our faculty is committed to addressing the myriad issues affecting marginalized populations: education policy, the pre-school to prison pipeline, socio-emotional processes, political dynamics, community organizing, institutional change, and so much more. CHST majors earn a Bachelor of Science degree and are prepared to matriculate to graduate studies in fields, such as teacher education, social work, counseling, psychology, law and more. CHST advisors can provide information about teaching credential programs and many other vocations requiring further graduate or professional school education. Our CHST alumni pursue careers in social work, teaching, counseling, family law, speech and language pathology, occupational therapy, or nonprofit agencies that provide community services to children and families.

(4 units)

### 4. Cultural Competence and Humility with Children and Families 

Cultural competence and humility taken together allow us to better communicate, listen, teach, learn, support, and lead in multiple contexts.

This course is designed to cultivate knowledge of self and others while also promoting a formative anti-oppression framework. Through readings, films, discussion, and trainings, we will devote ourselves to the rigorous examination of personal, interpersonal, and systemic/structural racism, classism, sexism, heterosexism, ageism, ableism, and religious discrimination toward the pursuit of social justice with children and families.

This course focuses on education in large urban contexts, with a particular emphasis on students from low-income environments. Ethnicity and class are two critical lenses that examine the reasons for: (a) historical contexts underlying education in urban contexts; (b) lack of cultural competence, school failure, underachievement, and the preschool to prison pipeline; and (c) the politics and policy of education reform.

Student learning in this course culminates with transdisciplinary perspectives, acknowledging the powerful complexity and potential of the arts to serve as a bridge between diverse fields and perspectives creating new epistemologies. Final research papers have students investigating arts education efforts and organizations dedicated to the most pressing issues of our time (democracy, peace, diplomacy, the environment, migration, economic and social disparities, etc.), and offering imaginative analysis of ways to better serve the human family, particularly children and youth, via generative, creative, artful solutions.
