The major program in history provides students with an understanding of the human experience through the analysis of evidence derived from both the recent and more distant past. As history majors, students learn essential skills, understand the breadth and similarities of the human experience, and acquire specific geographical and thematic knowledge. A degree in history provides excellent preparation for careers in education, journalism, media, government, law, business, and international affairs---all of which are careers that utilize the history major's expertise in discovering, organizing, and analyzing the forces that shape the contemporary world.

Lower-Division Course: Global History
-------------------------------------

### 21. Human Rights and Humanitarianism

From reading current news articles, one might surmise that the dignity of human beings and their inherent right of freedom from undue suffering are self-evident, universally acknowledged goods that we should all pursue regardless of culture, place, or time. In fact, however, contemporary ideas about human rights, as well as humanitarian efforts, (often pursued in far distant locales) have a particular history, one rooted in Western Enlightenment-era ideals of individual liberty and the brutal experiences of European imperialism. In this class, we will examine the histories and ideologies of human rights and humanitarianism; consider their underlying assumptions and power dynamics; and investigate the ways these histories relate to current legal, political, and humanitarian organizations and movements. (4 units)

### 43. The Haitian Revolution in World History and Memory

Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the "age of democratic revolutions." This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island. This course will examine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, its near erasure from Western historical memory, and the literary and historical recovery of its importance in the 20th and 21st centuries. (4 units)

### 68. Global 1968

History is not only an account of what happened, but also why things change. This class will focus on the political, cultural and social events of 1968, both within and without the United States, and the legacies and ramifications for twenty-first century political culture. A better comprehension of where we are at present comes from an understanding of the past. In addition to gaining some knowledge of history, the aim of this course is to help students improve their interpretive analyses and critical thinking skills through reading, writing, and class discussions. (4 units)

### 79. Technology: Steam to Cyborgs

This course provides an overview of important technological advances since the Industrial Revolution and takes a close look at a few specific technological touchstones from the 1760s to the 1920s. The rise of machines during this period profoundly influenced and challenged what it means to be human. A key goal is to question and explore the social and cultural context of emerging technologies and use the past as a guide for preparing ourselves in our own time of rapid change. Topics include the factory system, steam engines, photography, sound recording, cinema, industrial automation and design, and artificial intelligence. (4 units)

### 93. Cold War

This course concentrates on the origins and consequences of the Cold War from a global perspective. The course covers the period from 1945 until 1991, considering economic, political, and social implications of the ideological conflict of communism versus capitalism. The course explores the origins of the conflict, the formation of opposing blocs, the interplay between periods of tension and détente, the engagement with contemporary anti-colonialism movements, and the relationship between the center of the conflict in the North Atlantic/European arena and its global periphery, the demise of the Soviet Union, and the enduring legacies of the Cold War. (4 units)

Upper-Division Courses: Global History
--------------------------------------

### 102S. Genocide and Gender in the 20th Century

This course explores the gendered dimensions of genocide, focusing largely but not only on the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, the Holocaust during World War II, the Bosnian genocide in the 1990s after the collapse of communism in the former Yugoslavia, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Also listed as WGST 108. (5 units)

### 116. Sex and Gender in the Age of High Imperialism

An examination of the role of sexuality and gender in the global expansion of European hegemony in the 19th and 20th centuries. Explores these themes through literature, historical scholarship, and film. Also listed as WGST 124. (5 units)

### 121. Human Rights and Humanitarianism

From reading current news articles, one might surmise that the dignity of human beings and their inherent right freedom from undue suffering are self-evident, universally acknowledged goods that we should all pursue regardless of culture, place, or time. In fact, however, contemporary ideas about human rights, as well as humanitarian efforts (often pursued in far distant locales), have a particular history, one rooted in Western Enlightenment-era ideals of individual liberty and the brutal experiences of European imperialism. In this class, we will examine the histories and ideologies of human rights and humanitarianism, consider their underlying assumptions and power dynamics, and investigate the ways these histories relate to current legal, political, and humanitarian organizations and movements. (5 units)

### 123. History of Plagues, Epidemics, and Infections

An exploration of scientific, social, cultural, political, and ethical contexts in the history of infectious diseases and epidemics.

(5 units)

### 124. History of Sexually Transmitted Diseases

This course will survey the impact of sexually transmitted infections in a variety of national contexts, from the early modern period to recent times. The focus is mainly upon the history of classic venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea as well as more recently HIV/AIDS. How have medical debates about sexual contagion both influenced and been influenced by cultural conventions of blame, stigma, and moral judgment? Do representations of STDs provide a window into how a society organizes gendered expectations and constructs an image of deviant sexuality? How have responses to the problem of STDs changed over time? Can we examine these changes to better understand broader cultural adjustments to issues as diverse as prostitution and promiscuity, medical treatment and prophylaxis, and the politics of feminism, gay rights, and patients rights. (5 units)

### 138S. Gender and Rights in the Modern Era

This seminar examines gender and rights in the contexts of citizenship, marriage and divorce, reproduction, health, the workplace, the body, and other categories of analysis with cases taken from modern Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Oceania. Also listed as WGST 127. ( 5 units)

### 143. The Haitian Revolution in World History and Memory

Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the "age of democratic revolutions." This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it.

This course will examine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, its near erasure from Western historical memory, and the literary and historical recovery of its importance in the 20th and 21st centuries. (5 units)

### 145. Islam in the Modern World

### 131. Britain and the First World War

World War I gave birth to a range of difficult questions regarding the relationship between democratic ideals and how societies organize for modern conflicts, setting a strong pattern for the 20th century and continuing to possess strong resonances for today.

What forces propel individuals to assist or resist modern war making?
