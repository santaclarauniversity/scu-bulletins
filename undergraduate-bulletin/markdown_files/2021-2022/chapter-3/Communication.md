The Department of Communication offers a program of studies leading to a bachelor of arts in communication. The major prepares students for a wide variety of graduate studies and for careers in the communication industry. A minor in digital filmmaking or journalism is also available. Students explore the theories, research methods, responsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass communication, interpersonal communication, strategic communication, and computer-mediated communication. The major also integrates theory with practice. We help students to apply their knowledge of the communication process to create their own speeches, films, television programs, journalism, Web content, and communication and marketing campaigns. Many of our students go directly to work in these fields after graduation.

Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students integrate courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often, students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related disciplines. To encourage students to explore global studies, the department accepts up to two approved study abroad courses toward completion of the communication course requirements, usually as upper-division electives. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus media organization or other communication-related institution. Internships may be counted for course credit as a department elective. In their senior years, all communication majors synthesize their learning in the department by completing a scholarly thesis (on any aspect of communication) or an applied capstone project (in journalism, digital filmmaking, or strategic communication/public relations). Theses and capstone projects, which typically embody students' most advanced work, are suitable for submission as part of applications for graduate school and jobs.

Students interested in communication, including nonmajors, enjoy a wealth of co-curricular opportunities. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media, including the student newspaper, radio station, and yearbook. Practicum courses allow students to gain academic credit for working in student media. Santa Clara Debate, one of the oldest forensic programs in continuous operation on the West Coast, provides a challenging and rigorous co-curricular activity designed to develop public speaking skills, critical thinking, and public policy analysis. Policy debate participants are eligible to apply for merit scholarships.

All courses taken to fulfill requirements for the major or minor must be four or five units and must be taken for a letter grade, not on a pass/no pass basis. Practicum courses, numbered 190 through 195, do not count toward fulfillment of the communication major or minor.

We will sometimes be meeting in game environments in lieu of Zoom, and I'll be showing you demos in VR. I would like you all to experience VR as well, but that's certainly not possible in online classes.

Illnesses afflicting the population in the United States continue to shift towards lifestyle-related diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Public health campaigns can help to curtail this shift by promoting awareness and impacting behavioral changes.

### 155A. Media Literacy

Information is everywhere. We now live in an information-saturated environment. How do we cope with information overload? In this course, we will explore how taking a social scientific media literacy approach to understanding mediated communication can illuminate how we should best manage and cope with information overload. Several questions will guide the course: What is media literacy? How do historical and economic context affect the way we process information we are exposed to? How can individuals become more media literate to cope and manage information overload? These questions are particularly urgent for us to think about in relation to contemporary digital communication, as they are increasing the amount of information we are exposed to. We explore these questions through various activities in the course, reviewing what media literacy is, what components are needed to become media literate, and how to use a media literacy approach to dissect different types of industry through practical application.

Second, the course will analyze the aesthetic appeal of music from different traditions, in terms of the impact of lyrics, melodies, and other elements of songs and compositions. And, third, it will consider how global music reflects and, in turn, shapes politics and power relations, whether in everyday life or in movements for social change and political protests. The course will look at how musical genres from particular areas of the world have traveled and taken on new forms in other parts of the globe, for example, how African rhythms have shaped jazz and rock or how American protest songs of the 60s have been deployed as powerful statements against authoritarianism continents away. We will pay special attention to the impact of internet-related developments on global music, such as the disruption to the industry caused by streaming technologies and platforms like Spotify, new forums now available to musicians, such as YouTube, and direct access to global audiences without traditional channels of distribution.
