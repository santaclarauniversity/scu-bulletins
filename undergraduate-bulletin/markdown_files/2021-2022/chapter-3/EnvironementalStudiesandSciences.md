The Department of Environmental Studies and Sciences (ESS) offers interdisciplinary programs of study leading to a bachelor of science in environmental science or environmental studies. A minor in environmental studies is also available. These programs provide students with the intellectual foundation they will need in addressing crucial environmental challenges of the 21st century such as human population growth, urban development, food and agricultural systems, deforestation, global climate change, waste disposal, air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity, and the need for renewable energy.

ESS programs are enriched by colloquia featuring presentations on environmental topics by scholars and practitioners. Majors in ESS are expected to apply their knowledge outside the classroom by completing an approved internship or research experience. During their senior year, ESS students conduct research or an interdisciplinary group project with community stakeholders in ENVS 101 (Capstone Seminar).

ESS students are encouraged to study abroad. Courses such as ENVS 144 (Natural History of Baja L&L) include one week of immersion travel during University academic year breaks. Some summer and academic year courses taken through approved study abroad programs will count toward the requirements of the ESS majors and minors.

Each student works with a faculty advisor, who helps integrate the classroom curriculum with the student's plans for future study and/or work in environmental fields.

Conservation is a scientific enterprise and a social movement that seeks to protect nature, including Earth's animals, plants, and ecosystems. Conservation science applies principles from ecology, population genetics, economics, political science, and other natural and social sciences to manage and protect the natural world. Conservation is all too often seen as being at odds with human well-being and economic development. This course explores the scientific foundations of conservation while highlighting strategies to better connect conservation with the needs of a growing human population. We will examine whether conservation can protect nature, not from people, but for people. Also listed as BIOL 153. Prerequisite: BIOL 1C or ENVS 21. (5 units)

### 155. Environmental and Food Justice

This course unites two vibrant fields for academic study and arenas for social, political, and ecological action. Environmental justice as a principle affirms the right of all people to healthy livable communities. Environmental injustice occurs when environmental benefits and burdens are unevenly distributed along the lines of identity, including race, class, and/or nationality. Food justice research addresses inequalities in food access and studies the patterns, causes, and solutions associated with increasing hunger and obesity among eaters and the accumulation of environmental costs in agricultural landscapes. After reviewing several seminal studies in environmental and food justice, this class delves into case studies in California and Central America. Learners will conduct a major research project, participate in team-based collaborations, and engage local communities as part of this course. Prerequisite: ENVS 22 or ENVS 79 recommended. (5 units)

### 156. General Ecology L&L

Quantitative study of the interrelationships of organisms with their biotic and abiotic environments. Emphasis on population dynamics, interspecific relationships, community structure, and ecosystem processes. Laboratory and field work 30 hours, including one weekend field trip.

This course covers fundamental concepts in hydrology and water resources management such as precipitation, runoff and infiltration, flow in streams and aquifers, floods and droughts, water budgets, water delivery systems, and stream restoration, water cycling, use, treatment, water pollution, and conservation. Interactions between water and human societies, ecosystems, agriculture, natural resources, and climate are explored through domestic and international case studies. Course concepts are reinforced through indoor and outdoor class and laboratory exercises and field trips. Laboratory 30 hours. Prerequisites: ENVS 23. ENVS 21 and 22 recommended. (5 units)

### 161. Water Security

UN millennium development goals include access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation for all people, yet in many places those have remained an elusive goal. Water security invokes the idea of risk, but also of action, and resonates with governments, managers, academics, donors, activists, and organizations. In this course students analyze frameworks and approaches to water security. Through critical evaluation of the recent literature and principles from the fields of environmental science and studies, students gain perspectives on barriers and solutions to safeguarding access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, ecosystems, and human well-being. Prerequisite: Junior or senior standing. (5 units)

### 166. Climate Change: Past to Future L&L

Human-caused changes to the climate system are now widely accepted and expected to have great effects on physical, biological, and human systems from sea level rise to human disease, ocean acidification, and mass extinction. We will explore climate change in three broad units: (1) foundational aspects of the climate system such as Earth's energy balance, greenhouse effect, carbon cycle, and circulation of the oceans and atmosphere; (2) evolution of the climate system throughout Earth's history; and (3) impacts, vulnerabilities, and solutions for modern climate change. Students will model Earth's energy balance; examine Earth's carbon and water cycles in the field and lab; experimentally determine sea level rise with water isotopes; and use climate models to predict future changes. Lectures and discussions of current scientific literature and government documents will be motivated by student interest. Laboratory 30 hours. Prerequisite: ENVS 23. (5 units)

### 180. Energy and the Environment

This course exposes students to the connection between energy resources and human development, public health, and societal inequity. Students explore both traditional non-renewable supplies (coal, petroleum, natural gas, and nuclear) and renewables (natural gas, nuclear, biomass, wind, solar, hydropower, and geothermal), while recognizing the importance of energy conservation and storage. Students will explore the energy for the United States, comparing visionary scientific research with current and proposed policy strategies. Students will gain an understanding of the vast array of societal and environmental impacts of our energy demands, while defining opportunities and challenges for the future. Prerequisite: ENVS 23 recommended. (5 units)

### 185. Garbology

This class follows the path of our waste products as they are landfilled, burned, treated, recycled, reused, dumped on minority communities, or shipped abroad. Building on basic chemical and biological principles, we explore the ultimate fate of organic and inorganic waste. We look to the past and to other societies to better understand how we got to this throw-away society and what we can learn from past practices and other cultures. We explore sustainable solutions, including new efforts to reduce our waste such as "extended producer responsibility", design-for-disassembly, green chemistry, and zero waste. Students will also learn how to utilize the "life cycle analysis" approach as a basis for those daily decisions such as paper versus plastic. Prerequisite: ENVS 23 or permission of instructor. (5 units)

### 191. Urban Agriculture Practicum 

The rise in urban populations, in conjunction with industrial agriculture, has resulted in a disconnect between the public and their food system. Urban farms are diverse spaces that are utilized by a wide variety of groups for food security, food sovereignty, education, and connection to nature. Through lectures and hands-on activities held at SCU's Forge Garden and Bronco Urban Garden, students will learn practical skills in sustainable urban food production. In addition to their experiential learning placement at a local school garden in downtown San Jose, students will explore urban farming models through field trips and through visits from guest speakers working in urban agriculture in Silicon Valley. (2 units)

### 195. Sustainable Living Undergraduate Research Project (SLURP)

This two-quarter research-based course is designed to promote a culture of sustainability at Santa Clara University and also fulfills the ESS internship requirement.
