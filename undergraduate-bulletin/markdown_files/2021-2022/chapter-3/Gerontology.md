Gerontology Certificate Program
===============================

*Director:* Patricia M. Simone

Gerontology is the study of the aging process and adults over 65. Majors from any field may enhance their credentials and their ability to work with this population through the Gerontology Certificate Program. Students examine influences of the roles and quality of life of aged adults as well as physical and psychological aspects of aging. Courses investigate perceptions about aging and aged adults in various societies and how the experiences of older people differ according to culture, ethnicity, class, and gender. Students complete a practicum that gives them experience working with aged adults. Completion of the Gerontology Certificate Program is noted on a student's transcript and with a certificate acknowledging their achievement.
