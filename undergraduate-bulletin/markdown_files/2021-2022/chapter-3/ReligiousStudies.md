The Department of Religious Studies offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of arts in religious studies. The department also offers a minor program for those who wish to concentrate in theological and religious studies. In keeping with the University's commitment to the Catholic faith tradition, the department offers a variety of courses in Scripture, history, and Catholic theology. Faithful to the Jesuit tradition of liberal education and engagement with other religions, the department offers a wide breadth of courses in various religious traditions and methodologies for the study of religion. The department also offers courses as part of the undergraduate Core Curriculum, at both lower-division and upper-division levels. Courses are clustered in three areas: Theology, Ethics, and Spirituality (TESP); Scripture and Tradition (SCTR); and Religion and Society (RSOC).

Lower-Division Courses: Scripture and Tradition (SCTR)
------------------------------------------------------

### 15. Texting God

This course explores how people express their beliefs and how the technologies they use shape what they say. Focusing on Jewish and Christian "texts" (oral, written, visual, gesture), we'll examine the core beliefs that communities inscribe in them. We'll also consider how scriptural memes are reconstructed in the ongoing process of building cultural memory. We'll learn to analyze the rhetoric of various modes, and ask how changing technologies are altering our experience of text, scripture, and our relationships with God. (4 units)

### 19. Religions of the Book

This course offers an introduction to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam with a study of their central texts, traditions and practices. We begin the course with a paradox: religion, that which in its literal sense "binds" or "fastens together," is also that which often violently divides our world. As we examine the sacred texts of Jews, Christians, and Muslims (Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran), and various methods of interpreting them, our focus will remain on what is shared and what characteristically distinguishes between the monotheistic faiths. (4 units)

### 26. Gender in Early Christianity

The history of early Christianity is often portrayed as a history of, by, and about men, despite clear indications that women played a prominent role in the early church. Introduces the construction of gender in antiquity, Jewish and Greco-Roman laws and customs, the biblical canon, and other Christian texts. Contemporary feminist perspectives will inform the discussion. Also listed as WGST 46. (4 units)

### 27. Digging Up Jesus

This course examines the archaeological and literary evidence for Jesus. We'll use these primary "texts" to reconstruct the most plausible context for Jesus' work so that we can better understand the Gospel message, and learn the criteria for assessing whether he really said and did what the Gospels report. We'll also try to appreciate what the Gospel authors were doing in translating Jesus for their communities, just as we are doing ourselves with the historical approach of the course. (4 units)

### 28. Women In the Hebrew Bible

This course explores stores, tropes, metaphors, poetry, and archaeology related to Hebrew Bible and Old Testament (HB/OT) women. Biblical studies methodologies and interdisciplinary lenses will be used to create access points with the material culture of the Ancient Near East (ANE), literary life and afterlives of biblical texts, as well as intersectional juxtapositions between ANE and contemporary lives of women. We will explore questions such as: Did God have a wife? Are the oldest parts of the HB/OT written by women? How many different ways can families be defined? How does the HB/OT promote leadership and women? Also listed as WGST 21. (4 units)

### 39. Biblical Women and Power

Hero, villain, prophet, deviant---these are some of the power roles embodied by women in the Bible. Explores the exercise of power by biblical women in actual and figurative situations, in culturally positive and negative ways. Attention will be given to the continuing impact of such traditions for gender socialization in our world today. Also listed as WGST 47. (4 units)

### 48. Racializing Jesus

The course explores the various ancient and contemporary ethnic representations of Jesus in art, film, regalia, and scripture. Although portraits of Jesus as a white, blue-eyed prophet, messiah, or rabbi haunt the popular cultural imagination, these often reflect the social location and racial biases of Western scholars. But, what if Jesus was black, non-white Latinx, Amerindian, Asian, or Jewish? And, why is contemporary scholarship still grappling with the idea of Jewish messiah? In order to map the politics of interpretation and presentation, the course seeks to "radicalize" Jesus by (1) exploring his Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (2) critically engaging sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; (3) interrogation of the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship; and (4) mapping the implications for marginalized ethnic communities and interracial dialogue. Key themes to explore include: race/ethnicity, colonialism and imperialism, the quests for historical Jesus, Hitler's Third Reich, eugenics, interreligious dialogue, police violence (Ferguson & Baltimore), and the polemic over Jesus' wife. (4 units)

Upper-Division Courses: Scripture and Tradition (SCTR)
------------------------------------------------------

### 111. Bible and Ecology

The Christian tradition has long been known for its anthropocentrism (human-centeredness), and traditional interpretations of the Bible have perpetuated the idea that God made the universe for humans, leaving other creatures to struggle amid both evolutionary forces and devastating human actions. What does the Bible really "say" about creation? What is the ethical significance of Jewish and Christian perspectives on the natural world, given our planet's threatened state? (5 units)

### 112. Martyrdom

This course interrogates the role of sacred texts in legitimizing contemporary discourses on martyrdom or "Dying in God." Crucial questions to explore include: What is martyrdom and its relationship to ancient notions of noble death? Why are notions of martyrdom so prevalent amongst Christian, Jewish, and Muslim fundamentalist groups today? How is the Torah, the Bible, and the Quran used to legitimate violence against the self and others? Key themes to explore include: notions of a noble death in antiquity, imperial violence (crucifixion), the book of Revelation, martyrdom in early Christianity, the Crusades, Jonestown, Branch Davidians, secularization, fundamentalism (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim), suicide bombing, school shootings, and the rise of the Islamic State. (5 units)

### 128. Human Suffering and Hope

Explores issues of human suffering, justice, and belief in light of the biblical book of Job. Best for students interested in the creative arts, fiction writing, or community service. (5 units)

### 132. Apocalypse Now

This course provides a comparative introduction to ideas/symbols/theologies of the "End of the World" in three major monotheistic religions. In view of the influence of apocalyptic thought upon contemporary American culture in particular, and Western and non-Western societies in general, this course prepares students to responsibly engage in discussions of "End of the World" scenarios and their religious, socioeconomic, political implications. Themes germane to the course include: colonialism, environmental disasters (e.g., Pentecostalism), and alternative religious violence (e.g., Jonestown). In order to help students explore and articulate these themes, the course will provide various interpretive approaches from the theories and methods in the study of religion. We conclude the course by reflecting on the influence of apocalyptic thought upon our own spirituality, hopes, and religious traditions. (5 units)

### 157. The Bible and Empire

This course explores how politics shaped the Bible as it was being written and as it has been interpreted. Specifically, we will study how the experiences of empires in antiquity colored the assumptions about power, the portrait of God, and narratives of salvation that fill biblical books. We will also examine how the Bible is implicated in recent imperial adventures, both as a tool of European and American empires, and as a liberating resource for those they colonized. Also listed as WGST 153. (5 units)

### 158. Postcolonial Perspectives on the New Testament

Introduces students to postcolonial critical theory and uses it to explore the political contexts of New Testament texts, raising new questions about the ethical implications of how we read these texts today. Also listed as WGST 147. (5 units)

### 165. Gender and Sexuality in Biblical Interpretations

This course opens the Bible to critical readings from feminist and queer theory. It examines the original contexts of contested passages (creation, the destruction of Sodom, the role of women in early Christianity) as well as subsequent interpretation, and exposes the insights and ethical challenges that gender studies pose to these classic texts. Also listed as WGST 148. (5 units)

### 175. Wealth, Work, and the Gospel

This course explores how Jews and Christians understood the significance of wealth and work in the Bible and in later interpretation of those texts. Beginning with the Jewish scriptures, we will probe the economic contexts of emerging beliefs and practices, and then trace how these traditions were reshaped in the New Testament, the early and medieval churches, and the Protestant Reformation. This course concludes with the rise of capitalism and a comparison of capitalist and Gospel values. (5 units)

A theological examination of the Christian tradition covering such topics as religious experience and the meaning of God; Jesus in the Gospels; the development and history of the Christian churches; and the relevance of Christianity in the 21st century global world. (4 units)

### 16. Religion, Science, and Ecology

Science and religion provide distinctive ways of seeing, knowing, and living in the world. Yet they are often seen as being in conflict---to the detriment of religious practice and concern for the natural world. Must religion and science compete? How might they come together to promote the flourishing of the universe and all its creatures? This course engages religious perspectives on science from the standpoint of the world's religions, exploring how religion and science might cooperate for the good of all life on a planet threatened by ecological degradation. (4 units)

### 114. **Latinx Pentecostal Christianities**

The course begins with the historical background of the Azusa Street Revival and the development of Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianities in Latinx communities in the United States. Building on this historical background, students then explore the current-day structures and diverse practices of Latinx Pentecostal/Charismatic communities. Students will reflect on how Latinx Pentecostal/Charismatic religious and ethical principles apply to their own beliefs, whether they be Christian, another religion, agnostic, or atheist. (4 units)

### 26. Sustainable Theologies

### 52. Incarnating the Word: Theology and Theatre

Despite the often anxious relationship between Christianity and the performing arts, Jesuit education has long emphasized the importance of performance in forming integral human beings conscious of their place in the universe and competent to assume their roles on the stage of the world *ad maiorem Dei gloriam*. This interdisciplinary course aims at reverencing this educational tradition by exploring the dynamic relationships between fundamental theology and theatrical performance. By reading and considering theological texts alongside plays from a variety of historical periods, students will develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of theology as theatrical and theatre as theological. Also listed as THTR 109. (4 units)

### 56. Spirituality and Leadership

Leadership styles and approaches vary according to individual gifts, domain specific practices, cultural, scientific, historical, economic, social and theological contexts. No individual functions as a leader in the same way, but all are called to serve as leaders in some capacity. This course looks at how a selection of leaders were inspired, developed, challenged or rejected religious goals, theological interpretations of the human person and spiritual practices. (4 units)

### 59. Sex and Spirituality in Latinx and Chicanx Literature and Theologies

Upper-Division Courses: Theology, Ethics, and Spirituality (TESP)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

An exploration of fundamental theological themes in light of the current transhumanism movement. Transhumanism looks to the innovations and convergences of biotechnology, nanotechnology, robotics, information and communication technology, and neurosciences. The transhumanist movement promises much and raises many new questions. How do belief systems, theological investigations, and spirituality enter into a conversation with transhumanism? Will transhumanism completely change what it means to be a human? A person? How does transhumanism challenge our understanding of the concept of soul? God? These are some of the questions and themes we will explore in the course. (5 units)

### 108. Human Trafficking and Christian Ethics

This course will examine the global phenomenon of human trafficking---specifically sex trafficking and forced labor trafficking---using the lenses of Christian theology and ethics.

### 110. Theologies of Freedom and Justice

In response to global freedom struggles and other social movements during the latter half of the twentieth century, the face and character of contemporary Christian theology dramatically changed as new theological voices from within the United States and around the world, primarily from peoples of color and women in addition to other traditionally marginalized and excluded communities, arose in resistance and self-affirmation to expose and decry systematic injustice, inequality, and oppression in various contexts. This course aims to investigate, analyze, understand, and critique the theological assertions, contributions, and limitations of these new theological perspectives. (5 units)

### 113. Design Theory, Innovation, and Jesuit Principles

Corporations around the world respond differently to technological innovation and change. In this course we will focus on and develop one particular strategy, that of design theory. By critiquing best business practices and the organizational and theoretic ordering of the Society of Jesus, a unique vision of the human person and a company emerges that offers a humanistic approach and response to the introduction of new technologies. (5 units)

### 119. Theology, Sex, and Relationships

This course will explore the ethics of romantic and sexual relationships, including friendship, dating, intimacy, and the phenomenon of "hooking up" in contemporary campus culture.

(5 units)

### 122. Good and Evil

This course explores the theological theme of good and evil, with a particular focus upon evil. The nature of the good requires our attention, but not our explanation. By definition, the good show be; we desire it, and desire that it be. Evil, on the other hand, arrests our attention and demands a response. Why is there evil? Whence does it come? Is there a "solution" to the problem of evil? Is our suffering simply meaningless? Can it be understood? Or should it merely be recognized? Most centrally, the question arises: what is the relationship between good, especially God, and evil? Should we hope? Can we? Is hell stronger than heaven? Does fire burn hotter than love? This is a text-driven course, built around "primary sources," mainly of a historical nature. We'll explore drama, biblical texts, philosophical writings, theological works, works of literature, film and television, and so on. (5 units)

### 124. Theology of Marriage

### 129. Religion and Peace

This course will explore the relationship between religion and peace by examining the call to peacemaking in several religious traditions. Understanding peace to be more than the absence of warfare, the class will consider foundational connections between justice and peace, varied definitions for peace and diverse perspectives on peacemaking, as well as distinct theological, ethical, and spiritual approaches to peace. A community-based learning placement through Arrupe Partnership will give students the opportunity to ground reflections on justice. (5 units)

### 130. Judaism and Political Philosophy

This course focuses on the intersection of modern Jewish thought and political philosophy. From the Hebrew Bible to modern thinkers like Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Martin Buber, the Frankfurt School, and Leo Strauss, Jewish thinkers have generated a remarkable textual conversation over what makes for a holy, just, and good society. We will explore the diverse philosophical and theological interpretive narratives by Jewish thinkers over the uses and abuses of political power in the modern era. This course provides an introductory overview of these conversations by additionally focusing on topics such as messianic resistance to empire, capitalism, religious violence, secularism, nationalism, Zionism, critical theory, ecology, feminism, liberal democratic rights, and redemption. (5 units)

### 131. Feminist Theologies

Through the analysis of a selected sample of feminist theological voices and themes, explores the phenomenon of feminist theologies in their emerging unity and diversity. Focuses on themes of inclusion, exclusion, and representation, which have also been major catalysts in the emergence of diverse feminist theologies. Also listed as WGST 149. (5 units)

### 135. Theological Anthropology and Artificial Intelligence

This course will explore the developing field of artificial intelligence (AI) by placing it into conversation with a speculative reading of theological anthropology. Theological anthropology argues that human nature must be understood in relationship with the transcendent. An exemplar of this approach, Hans Urs von Balthasar explores how a relationship with the transcendent influences our use of logic and our understanding of truth. Balthasar argues that logic and truth operate in the four areas of: (1) nature, (2) freedom, (3) mystery, and (4) participation. Is machine intelligence possible without incorporating these themes into its programming? By aligning the machine to each of these four broad concerns, will the machine then become not only self-conscious, but also, aware of the existence of a transcendent being? Can an adequately complex algorithm and comprehensive logic engine create the equivalent of a machine soul? (5 units)

### 142. Conscience, Christianity, and Politics

A study of the significant role that conscience has played in the history of Christian engagement with politics. We will study the meaning of conscience itself as it emerges in the works of great figures in the tradition. We will also consider the different ways in which the conscience of Christians has confronted the political order ranging from conscientious objection to civil disobedience to resistance to the collective conscience of a church in opposition to the state. Finally, conscience and Christianity and politics will be considered in light of crucial contextual matters like race and gender. (5 units)

### 143. Theology and Ethics of Thomas Aquinas

A study of the life, thought, and ethics of Aquinas. Basic topics to be discussed include the existence of God, human nature, and human participation in society. (5 units)

### 148. Christian Ethics and Controversial Topics

Have you ever wondered if Christians should take "sides" on public, controversial topics? Does Christian thought specify how we should begin to think about immigration, the death penalty, euthanasia, or racial justice? This course examines several contemporary social issues using the lenses of Christian theology and ethics, with a particular emphasis on Catholic Social Teaching. We will examine themes such as human dignity and human rights, the common good, economic justice, sin, solidarity, and a preferential option for the poor. In light of these themes, the course invites students to assess responses to various social topics, such as U.S. immigration, racism and civil rights, capital punishment, and state-sanctioned medically-assisted death. Although we will be using the lenses of Christian ethics to approach these topics, no assumptions will be made that students taking the course identify as Christian. (5 units)

### 149. Radical Theology: Death of God

This course introduces the student to the discipline of radical theology as a controversial modern method of understanding God in light of secularization. Beginning with suggestions of God's death in the Bible; then in Nietzsche, through an analysis of death-of-God positions submitted in 19th-century theology and philosophy; a consideration of Thomas J. J. Altizer and William Hamilton; and finally, the curriculum offers consideration of current Christian responses to secularization, human suffering and death-of-God (DOG) theology. (5 units)

### 165. Romero and the Salvadoran Martyrs

The age of martyrs is not a relic of the past but a reality of our own times. In many parts of the world, people are being murdered for their faith.

### 114. **Religion and Medicine in Health** C**are**

The history of the institutions of medicine and religion have long been intertwined in health care.
