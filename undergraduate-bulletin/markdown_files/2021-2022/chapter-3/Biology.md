The Department of Biology offers a program leading to the bachelor of science degree. The major provides students a solid foundation in the core concepts of modern biological thought, and provides students with critical skills to put concepts into practice. The biology major serves as a strong foundation for graduate, medical, or professional studies, as well as for careers in teaching, research, and business. Most courses emphasize laboratory or field work, and students are also encouraged to work with faculty on research projects. Most faculty members involve students in their research programs. Qualified students can obtain course credit for research by enrolling in BIOL 195, and for major research projects by enrolling in BIOL 198. Minor degrees in biology and related disciplines (biotechnology, biomedical engineering, public health, and environmental studies) are available. The Biology Department also offers the fundamental introductory curriculum for all of life science majors, as well as courses that satisfy the Natural Science and Science, Technology & Society requirements of the Core Curriculum, the latter of which are available to all University students who are curious about the nature of life. Numerous study abroad opportunities in the life sciences, both for biology majors and nonmajors, are available through the Study Abroad office.
