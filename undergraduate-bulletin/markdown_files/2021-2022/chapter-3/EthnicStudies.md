Ethnic studies is a compelling and dynamic discipline devoted to the critical examination of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and intersecting modes of inequality particularly as manifest in the experiences of historically marginalized populations. In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities while building on the critical studies of racialization and resistance with research and courses across a broad field including education, economic development, identity and empowerment, immigration, labor and employment, media, music, and popular culture, multiracial communities, sovereignty, transnational networks, voting rights, and political representation. Ethnic studies focuses on the roles and experiences of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations with particular attention paid to African Americans/Blacks, American Indian/Indigenous/Native Americans, Asian Pacific Islander, and South Asian Americans, Chicanas/os/xs and Latinas/os/xs and Middle Eastern and North Africans within the framework of the United States and within transnational networks. Coursework also emphasizes the comparative interaction between various racial/ethnic groups and cross-national approaches to their histories, cultural productions, and socioeconomic and political experiences.

As an academic department, Ethnic Studies fosters intersectional and interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of experts in critical racial and ethnic studies, while serving as teachers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. The Ethnic Studies Department strives to make connections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change, and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashioning a more equitable, humane, and just world. The Ethnic Studies Department serves as a resource for students, faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in examining race and ethnicity and its intersections with multiple modes of inequality including class, gender, citizenship, and nationality.

The department offers students the option to complete a major in ethnic studies (Bachelor of Science) or a minor in ethnic studies, African American studies, Asian American Studies, or Latina/o/x Studies. The major provides students with advanced and concentrated training in racial and ethnic studies with coursework clustered in the upper division around six themes: Community Engagement and Social Movements; Race, Law, Politics, and Policy; Intersectionality and Hybridity; Inequality and Education; Immigration, Transnationalism, and Globalization; and Social and Cultural Analysis. Both the stand alone major and three minors enhance a student's employment opportunities in business, community service work, education, law, medicine, social work, politics, and government and do important work in establishing a foundation for students to pursue racial and ethnic justice after graduation.. For those considering graduate school, the majors provide a foundation for graduate studies particularly for those who seek to become university professors and researchers with a specialization in a variety of issues and policies impacting racial and ethnic communities.

### 149. Civil Rights and Anti-Colonial Movements

This course examines the connections between two historical developments often treated separately: the U.S. civil rights struggle and African anti-colonial movements. By placing these two movements in a transnational framework, the course explores the global challenge to the racialized world order of the 19th and early 20th century. How did the civil rights struggle gain momentum in the aftermath of World War II? What was the longer history and role of "black nationalism" and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? What were the connections between the civil rights movement and contemporary independence movements in Africa and Asia? One of the central goals of the course is to show how we can expand our understanding of U.S. history by reaching beyond the interaction between the U.S. government and other nation-states to examine political and cultural change. Also listed as HIST 153. (5 units)

### 150. Urban Education and Multiculturalism

This course takes a critical multicultural approach to understanding urban education, encouraging a connection between theory and personal experience and observations. With a focus on schools in large urban contexts, this course centralizes the experiences of low-income, students of color. Race and class will be two critical lenses with which we will examine (1) the historical context of educational inequality, (2) current issues of educational inequity, and (3) the movement towards educational justice. Students should leave the course with a stronger understanding of the social and historical foundations of U.S. education. (5 units) Also listed as CHST 106.

### 160. Documentary Making for Social Justice

This creative course provides students the opportunity to write, dissect, and produce their own 10-minute documentaries that are committed to social justice. In addition to producing their own films, students will examine how documentary filmmakers use film as a medium to heighten the consciousness of their audience, combat negative stereotypes, give voice to marginalized or underrepresented groups, and raise social awareness about issues affecting their diverse communities. Reading film as "text"---complete with their own arguments, aesthetic concerns, social, political, and historical influences---we will understand how documentaries are used to illuminate disparities or confront issues of inequity and injustice. Specifically, we will examine the intersection of gender, race, class, spirituality, and sexuality, and note how these dynamics function in film to enlighten our global community. Writers in this course will be moved from idea to script and, ultimately, film. (5 units)

### 161. Creating Diverse College-Going Communities

In this course, students will develop an understanding of diversity issues in college access, reflect on their own experiences, utilize this knowledge to develop workshop curriculum to enhance college-going, and then implement this curriculum in high school classrooms as a community-based learning opportunity. This course introduces students to the background of colleges and universities in the United States, (including history, institutional types, and diverse student representation), then explores the many factors that influence college access and experiences in college (including class, race, gender, first-generation college student status, financial aid, and admissions processes). Students will reflect on their own college application and selection process and their experiences in college. Using this knowledge, students will engage in community-based learning (CBL) in which they provide college-related tutoring, mentoring, and workshops for high school students. (5 units)

### 162. Diversity and the Media

This course focuses on the complex, changing, dynamic, and powerful relationships between dominant and underrepresented groups in society, the mass media, and broader social contexts; and discusses media representations of social groups, contexts of media production, and media use among underrepresented groups. The concepts of hegemony, power, social construction, and intersectionality are vital for understanding these relationships, and vital for the course. The course connects to the field of cultural studies in that it focuses on the everyday uses of symbolic forms and aims to make students aware of, and sensitive to, some of the dynamics connected with media images, symbolic power, and the production of meaning in today's world. Students are encouraged to formulate, question, and put into context, their own versions of reality. Also listed as COMM 121A. (5 units)

### 163. Multiracial Communities in Central California

This course will examine the process of racialization in various communities throughout California and uncover how various ethno-racial groups within these communities live, work, and thrive together in their specific locales. This course will begin by interrogating definitions of community, spatial geography, political economy, as well as attempting to understand social attitudes about race and racism. Then we will examine various cities as case studies to understand the different ways multiracial communities formed. The end goal is to understand the nuances of how multiracial communities, both urban and rural, developed and inscribed meaning onto the geography of California. (5 units)

Students will examine decolonizing and anti-oppressive methodologies toward engaging in social justice and participatory action research. This course is designed to equip students with the skills and abilities to engage in community-based, action-oriented and collaborative research projects. The goal is for students to think critically and reflexively, while examining, reflecting and re/deconstructing how research methods and knowledge are reproduced. More specifically, this course engages students in community-based projects where knowledge is co-produced in collaboration with communities of color, who are most affected by social structural issues, and well positioned to identify and address injustices through direct-actions and/or deconstructing systems of power and oppression. This course is exclusively for ethnic studies majors and minors. (5 units)

In this course, students will be exposed to both theory and research that explore concepts including race and racism, racial microaggressions, stereotype threat, racial battle fatigue, internalized racism, and resistance. Students will examine the extent to which these forces impact multiple minority communities in K-16 contexts, as well as community efforts for social justice. (5 units)

### 175.  Black Power

This course explores the history of Black Power by examining the philosophical positions and plans of action that defined this branch of the Black Freedom Movement. As Black Power activists sought to fight racism and achieve liberation by asserting Black political, cultural, and economic autonomy, the course therefore centers critiques of capitalism, political organizing, community empowerment, and artistic expression as articulated and practiced by Black Power activists throughout the 20th century. (5 Units)

### 178. Race and World War II

World War II stands as one of the most explosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the postwar world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of "race" in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178. (5 units)

### 180. Race, Voting, Campaigns, and Elections

This class examines how the traditional vehicles of American political participation -- namely voting, campaigns, and elections -- have been racialized throughout American history and the particular impacts and responses among African Americans and Latinas/os/xs. As part of this examination we look closely at the participation of racial and ethnic minorities in various forms of electoral activity (as both voters and candidates), we analyze enduring obstacles to their political empowerment (both structural and resource constraints), and highlight efforts to remove those barriers. A critical examination of the upcoming national elections will feature prominently throughout this course and students will have the opportunity to examine local elections more closely through an original research project designed to study the intersection of race and voting in San Jose, California. (5 units)

### 184. Seminar - Women of Color in the United States

(5 units)

### 187. Seminar - Youth Activism & Contemporary Social Movements

Youth Activism & Contemporary Social Movements examines current social movements catalyzed and led by young people. The course specifically examines youth community organizing and youth activism as a context for social justice work that parallels, yet differs from the Civil Rights Movements of the 1960s. In this course, we engage an intersectional analysis of race, age, and other markers of identity and difference. Through this perspective we will examine the contributions and role of young people in contemporary 21st-century social movements from the 1960s through the present that have contributed to contemporary youth activisms. Within a U.S. context, social movements have often been grouped into three different time periods: the Civil Rights Movement, the post-1960s, and the contemporary social movements. The thematic organization of these periods reflects the different struggles experienced by social groups within societies, and the varied approaches and mechanisms through which communities and young people organized. Although these social movements and waves of political activism are characterized and shaped by the timeframe of their unique sociopolitical context, there are similarities across all periods. One similarity across these times frames concerns the significant leadership and activism of young people---children, youth, and young adults---to resist and challenge structures of power and systems of oppression. From Anti-Islamophobia movements; to Black Lives Matter; to Undocumented & Unafraid; to LGBTQ and women's rights movements; to the institutionalization of ethnic studies curricula and the ending of gun violence in schools---all of these movements underscore the power of young people. (5 units)

### 188. Seminar - Civil Rights and Anti-Colonial Movements 

This course examines the connections between two historical developments often treated separately: the U.S. civil rights struggle and anti-colonial movements across the globe. By placing these movements in a transnational framework, we will explore through readings and the production of an original research paper, the global challenge to the racialized world order of the modern world. What was the longer history and role of Black Nationalism and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? How did women contribute to the longer struggle against white supremacy in both the United States and colonial world? The central goal of the course is to expand our understanding of anti-racist struggle by moving beyond the formal boundaries of the United States of America in the 20th and 21st centuries. (5 units)
