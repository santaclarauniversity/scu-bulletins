General Engineering Program
===========================

*Director of General Engineering*: Jessica Kuczenski

*Lecturers*: Jessica Kuczenski, Matthew Gaudet

The School of Engineering, under the leadership of the director of general engineering, offers a major in general engineering, a minor in general engineering, and a minor in technical innovation, design thinking, and the entrepreneurial mindset. The bachelor of science degree in general engineering is designed to provide students a technical degree with concentrations designed to meet the needs of the individual student.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Program Coordinator:* Christopher Kitts

To solve the complex and interdisciplinary technical challenges of the modern world, students must understand the entrepreneurial methods appropriate for harnessing technical innovation in order to create value through new devices, products, systems, processes, services, and ecosystems. This minor addresses this need by providing students with learning experiences that address product innovation, business fundamentals, and entrepreneurial thinking; in doing so, it leverages themes and concepts promoted through movements such as design thinking, lean development, and business modeling. In addition, an experiential learning activity in the context of the entrepreneurial development of a real engineering system is required. Participation in an elective component is also required.

This minor program is suitable for undergraduates in a wide variety of disciplines. It places an emphasis on an understanding of the user and the business environment for the design and implementation of technologies and solutions that are appropriate, affordable, and accessible for consumers in a variety of markets. Students who complete the program will be able to adapt both themselves and the organizations in which they work in a way that will allow them to remain competitive and relevant as global consumer trends continue to evolve.

Combined Bachelor of Science and Master of Science Program
----------------------------------------------------------

General Engineering offers a combined degree program leading to a bachelor of science and a master of science. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for a bachelor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science within a year of completing the bachelor's degree.

Undergraduate students admitted to the combined degree program are required to enroll in the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the standard undergraduate degree requirements. To earn a master's degree, students must fulfill all requirements for the degree, including the completion of 46 units of coursework beyond that applied to the bachelor's degree. The program of studies for the master's degree may include up to 20 units taken while enrolled as an undergraduate student; however, no individual course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and master's degree.
