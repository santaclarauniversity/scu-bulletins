Marketing operates at the cutting edge of a well-managed organization. Development of students' decision-making and managerial skills are the major objectives of the Department of Marketing program, with special emphasis in innovation, high technology, retailing, and digital marketing. Marketing links a business to its markets and customers and acts as the eyes and the ears for a firm, helping managers to identify emerging market opportunities and anticipating customer needs and wants. It is also the firm's voice, handling communications with customers and deciding on advertising, sales, and social media messages. Finally, strategic marketing addresses competitive threats and opportunities, guiding a firm's efforts to deliver superior value. Because customer analysis and competitive advantage are so crucial to business success, a degree in marketing provides a solid foundation for a general management career leading to executive responsibilities. It can also provide the basis for a more focused career in such areas as advertising, retailing, sales, brand management, and market research.
