Retail Studies Minor
====================

*Executive Director:* Kirthi Kalyanam Ph.D

The Retail Management Institute (RMI) is a recognized academic partner of the retail industry with a 40-year history. We have a strong reputation for developing strategic leaders with the advanced skills necessary for success in the new technology infused world of retail.

RMI provides a platform for deep collaboration between industry and leading academics into the emerging and evolving concepts impacting retail today. The knowledge generated from this collaboration forms the basis of our curriculum.

The minor in retail studies offered by RMI is an in-depth immersion experience that prepares students for a diverse set of roles including e-commerce, buying, merchandising, planning and allocation, digital marketing, and supply chain management. Open to all University undergraduates, students entering the retail studies program continue to major in their field of interest and receive their bachelor's degree in that field.

Business majors get an opportunity to discover an exciting industry in which to build their passions. For many business majors, broad business theories develop deeper meaning as they are applied specifically and in an integrative manner to the retail industry. Retailing is at the forefront of trends in digital and mobile marketing and social media. This provides a fertile ground for arts and science students to leverage their unique background.

Comprised of a set of core required courses, the minor in retail studies includes foundational retailing classes in the spring quarter of junior year and a two-quarter class designed around the Art & Science of Merchandising and Retail Innovation in the fall and winter quarters of senior year. The core classes cover topics such as digital marketing, branding, product development, category management, business analytics, supply chain management, e-commerce, and pricing and promotion analysis and digital merchandising.

One of the valuable and unique aspects of the retail studies minor is participation in an internship during the summer after junior year. This immersive experience gives students insight into the retail industry and potential career options. Non-business majors are encouraged to apply for admission to the program during their first or second year to allow time to integrate their course of study in retailing with the requirements in their major field. Business students who have completed the lower-division requirements **can enter the program no later than November of their junior year**. Students are admitted into the minor at the discretion of the executive director based on multiple criteria including a minimum GPA of 3.3, proven analytical skills, the ability to blend analytical and creative thinking and previous exposure to retail.
