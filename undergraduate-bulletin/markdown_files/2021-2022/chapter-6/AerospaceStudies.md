Santa Clara University has an agreement with San Jose State University permitting Santa Clara students to enroll in a program leading to a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force (USAF) or United States Space Force (USSF). The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) program offers a high-quality educational experience for college students in Air Force organization, history, officer skills, leadership and management, and national security policy and issues. Classes are offered on the San Jose State University campus.

Integral to the curriculum are mandatory leadership laboratories. These weekly two-hour experiences provide a dynamic environment in which cadets develop leadership and management skills by planning, organizing, directing, and coordinating exercises. Physical fitness is also an important component to the AFROTC training program. Students/cadets are expected to meet twice a week (2 hours) to participate in group physical conditioning.
