University Programs
===================

Most undergraduate academic programs at Santa Clara University are administered by the College of Arts and Sciences, the Leavey School of Business, or the School of Engineering. Although Aerospace Studies and Military Science are administered by the College of Arts and Sciences, their programs, which do not lead to a degree but rather to the opportunity for commissioning, are open to all Santa Clara students.
