Students enrolled for fewer than 12 units at the end of the late registration period are charged the per-unit tuition rate.</p>

<h2 id="student-employment">Student Employment</h2>
<p><strong>Campus Employment</strong></p>
<p>Part-time jobs for undergraduate students are available in many offices and departments on campus. Campus job listings are maintained by the Student Employment Office.</p>
<p>Students earn an hourly wage at least at the current minimum wage rate for the state of California and may be paid at a higher rate depending on the type of work or skills required.</p>

<h2 id="loans">Loans</h2>
<p><strong>William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans</strong></p>
<p>William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans are federally funded low-interest loans provided to undergraduate students and administered by the United States Department of Education. Under the Federal Direct Loan program, a student may borrow funds for educationally related expenses and defer repayment until six months after graduation or when the enrollment status drops below half-time (e.g., less than 6 units). If an undergraduate is an independent student or a dependent student whose parents were denied for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, the student can borrow additional funds through the Federal Direct Loan program based on their academic grade level. To receive a subsidized Federal Direct Loan, a student must have financial need. Interest is not charged on a subsidized Federal Direct Loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time. Eligibility for unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans is determined after eligibility for subsidized Federal Direct Loans is decided. Interest accrues on unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans during all periods, including while the student is enrolled in school and during any grace or deferment periods.</p>
<p><strong>Federal Direct PLUS Loan</strong></p>
<p>A parent or stepparent of a dependent student may apply for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program to help cover the cost of educational expenses. To be eligible for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, a student must be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen and must be enrolled at least half-time. A parent may borrow up to the cost of attendance minus all other financial aid for each undergraduate child. An origination fee is deducted from the disbursement of the loan.</p>
<h2 id="financial-aid-eligibility">Financial Aid Eligibility</h2>
<p><strong>Enrollment Status and Financial Aid Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>Undergraduate students receiving financial aid must meet general University eligibility requirements and any applicable eligibility criteria associated with specific federal, state, or University aid programs from which they are receiving support. Financial aid recipients generally must be enrolled as full-time students in a minimum of 12 units each quarter in which aid is received, must be making satisfactory progress toward a degree, and must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. Financial aid awards to students who drop below full-time status (e.g., less than 12 units) will be adjusted unless certification for continuing eligibility is granted by the Financial Aid Office. Eligibility for institutional financial aid is limited to a maximum of 12 consecutive academic quarters of undergraduate study. Financial aid awards will cease after the 12 quarters of enrollment in a postsecondary institution unless certification for continuing eligibility is granted by the Financial Aid Office. Specific financial aid awards may have additional requirements for continuing eligibility.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education has basic eligibility requirements for financial aid, which must be met and maintained in order for a student to be eligible to receive aid. These requirements apply to all federal, state, and Santa Clara University--funded aid. A student must &quot;be enrolled in an eligible program as a regular student seeking a degree or certificate.&quot; Students cannot be awarded aid for classes that do not count toward their degree, certificate, or other recognized credential. In short, students are only eligible for federal, state, and University-funded aid when taking classes that are required to complete a degree (either major or minor). Once those degree requirements have been met and a student is eligible to graduate, he or she is no longer entitled to receive aid. This holds true even if the student has been here fewer than 12 academic quarters.</p>
<p>Students who are able to graduate because they have completed all of their degree requirements but <strong>decide to enroll for an additional term</strong> are not eligible to receive federal, state, or University-funded aid for the additional term. Students who believe that they may be impacted by the U.S Department of Education regulations should reach out to a financial aid counselor to discuss their particular circumstances. The University has developed responses to some frequently asked questions.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Standing and Satisfactory Progress Requirements</strong></p>
<p>All financial aid recipients must maintain good academic standing and be making satisfactory progress toward a degree according to the University standards and applicable federal and state regulations. Students are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress each quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Qualitatively</strong></p>
<p>Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. Note: Some Santa Clara University aid programs require a higher cumulative grade point average than the federal minimum requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Quantitatively</strong></p>
<p>Students must maintain a cumulative 67 percent completion rate for all units attempted toward their academic programs.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Attempted Units Allowed</strong></p>
<p>Students must complete the requirements for their academic programs within 150 percent of the minimum units required to complete their academic programs. Units attempted also include all units transferred into Santa Clara University from prior institutions that can be used to satisfy students&apos; academic program requirements. Students who have reached their maximum attempted units allowed are ineligible for additional financial aid. Students may appeal for financial aid probation status if they feel their circumstances warrant an exception to this standard.</p>
<p><strong>Unit Requirements</strong></p>
<p>All financial aid recipients must register for and maintain a full course load of 12 units or more per quarter, if the aid was awarded on this basis. Students who drop below 12 units may see their financial aid adjusted. Full-time and part-time status is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Full-time: 12 or more units</p>
</li>
<li><p>Three-fourths time: 9 to 11 units</p>
</li>
<li><p>Half-time: 6 to 8 units</p>
</li>
<li><p>Less than half-time: fewer than 6 units</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Course Incompletes, Withdrawal, Failures, and/or Repetitions</strong></p>
<p>Incompletes (I), Withdrawals (W), Failures (F), and/or repeated courses will adversely affect a student&apos;s completion rate. Students must complete the minimum number of units to fulfill federal, state, and University requirements. Completion rates are calculated cumulatively and will include all quarters that the student was enrolled, whether or not the student received financial aid.</p>
<p>Students who wish to withdraw from Santa Clara University during a quarter must complete a withdrawal form and an exit interview in the Drahmann Advising and Learning Resource Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student&apos;s registration will be canceled without academic penalty. A withdrawal notation (W) will be assigned for each course from which the student withdraws after the fourth week of the quarter. Students who leave Santa Clara University during a quarter without formally withdrawing are subject to failing grades in all courses in which they were registered and are ineligible for refund of tuition.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Any student leaving Santa Clara University at the conclusion of any quarter should also complete the standard withdrawal process.</p>
<p><strong>Repetition of Courses</strong></p>
<p>Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than C minus (C-). In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the calculation of the student&apos;s grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and performance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>All students enrolled at Santa Clara University are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress at the end of each quarter after the Office of Registrar has released official grades.</p>
<p><strong>Appeal Process</strong></p>
<p>There may be extenuating circumstances encountered by a student that affect his/her ability to be academically successful during an enrollment period. These circumstances include personal injury or illness that occurs during an enrollment period; death of an immediate family member or legal guardian during an enrollment period; or other documented circumstances that were unexpected in nature and beyond control of the student. In these cases, cumulative grade point average or completion rate may decline resulting in the student not meeting the minimum qualitative and quantitative standards previously described. If the student wishes to appeal the suspension from financial aid eligibility, a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal form must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office. If the appeal is approved, s/he will be placed on financial aid probation (separate from academic probation). Students will be notified of the appeal results in writing.</p>
<p><strong>Loss of Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>A student who has lost eligibility to participate in federal, state, and University aid programs for reasons of academic progress can regain that eligibility only by enrolling at Santa Clara University at his/her own expense. The mere passage of time will not restore eligibility to a student who has lost eligibility for failure to make satisfactory academic progress. Students who have been dismissed from Santa Clara University for academic reasons, but who are subsequently readmitted are not automatically eligible to participate in federal, state, or institutional aid programs and will be placed on financial aid warning. Re-admission decisions are separate from funding decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Regaining Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>Students who fail to meet satisfactory academic progress and who choose to enroll without financial aid may request a review of their academic record after any term in which they are enrolled without the receipt of financial aid. If the standards are met at the time of review, eligibility may be regained for subsequent terms of enrollment in the academic year.</p>
<h2 id="other-program-eligibility">Other Program Eligibility</h2>
<p><strong>Study Abroad and Global Programs</strong></p>
<p>Santa Clara University students participating in study abroad and domestic public sector study programs operated by or affiliated with the University are eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid and tuition remission as well as federal and state aid consistent with the policies and practices applicable to students enrolled for on-campus classes. Tuition and room and board rates associated with the specific program will be factored into the determination of the financial aid award consistent with applicable policies and practices. The total amount of tuition remission for the academic year cannot exceed the annual tuition rate for that year. Students with private scholarships should contact the donor for prior approval to use funds for study abroad or domestic study programs. Students from other colleges and universities enrolled in Santa Clara University study abroad programs are not eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid.</p>
<p><strong>Veterans and Veterans&apos; Dependents Assistance</strong></p>
<p>Santa Clara University has been certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 percent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill&#xAE;), Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill&#xAE;), and Yellow Ribbon. Individuals interested in attending under any of the veteran assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar.</p>
<p>GI Bill&#xAE; is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at <a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill" target="_blank">http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cancellation-of-financial-aid-and-return-of-funds">Cancellation of Financial Aid and Return of Funds</h2>
<p>Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are subject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal financial aid funds governed under Title IV other than those earned under the college work-study program.</p>
<p>Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled.</p>
<p>All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to state or University financial aid programs or to the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received Federal Title IV assistance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Subsidized Federal Direct Loans</p>
</li>
<li><p>Federal Direct PLUS Loans</p>
</li>
<li><p>Federal Pell Grants for which a return is required</p>
</li>
<li><p>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants for which a return is required</p>
</li>
<li><p>TEACH Grants for which a return is required</p>
</li>
<li><p>Iraq and Afghanistan Grants for which a return is required</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="student-verification-of-information">Student Verification of Information</h2>
<p>The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students and their families submit as a basis for the award of aid. Each year, a percentage of students receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the information on which their awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid and to verify the attendance of other children in college. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds.</p>
<h2 id="billing-and-payment-procedures">Billing and Payment Procedures</h2>
<h3 id="student-accounts-and-billing">Student Accounts and Billing</h3>
<p>Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Students may designate a third party (e.g., parent, family member, spouse) to be an authorized payer for the purpose of reviewing student account/billing information and remitting payments on the student&apos;s behalf. However, it is ultimately the student&apos;s responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the published deadlines.</p>
<p>Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through University eCampus. Billing notification will be sent to the student&apos;s assigned SCU gmail account and to the email address of any authorized payer. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remittance. Information on a student&apos;s account cannot be provided to any third party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University.</p>
<p>Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees associated with their enrollment status by the published term payment deadline, regardless of receiving a billing statement. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to prepay for their enrollment. Registered students who do not withdraw formally from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their student account as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees.</p>
<h3 id="payment-methods">Payment Methods</h3>
<p>Santa Clara University offers a variety of payment methods to students and their parents to assist with their financial obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Payment by Electronic Check</strong></p>
<p>A student or authorized payer may make online payments by authorizing a fund transfer directly from their personal checking or savings account through a third-party website accessible via the University eCampus system. The payer is able to make electronic check payments online without incurring a transaction fee.</p>
<p><strong>Payment by Mail</strong></p>
<p>Payments for student account charges are accepted by mail utilizing the University&apos;s cash management service lockbox. The payer should download a copy of the student&apos;s billing statement, enclose it with a personal or cashier&apos;s check payable to &quot;Santa Clara University,&quot; and mail both items to: SCU Payment Processing, P.O. Box 550, Santa Clara, CA 95052-0550.</p>
<p><strong>Payment in Person</strong></p>
<p>Payments for student account charges may be made in person by cash or check only at the OneStop Office located in the Admissions and Enrollment Services Building. The Office is not able to accept any electronic form of payment. However, there are computer kiosks located in the Admissions and Enrollment Services Building for the convenience of students and their payers who wish to make electronic payments. The University does not accept credit cards as payment for student account charges.</p>
<h3 id="extended-payment-options">Extended Payment Options</h3>
<p>For students and their families wishing to spread payments over a period of time, the University offers term payment plans, which are available through the online billing system via eCampus or authorized payer login. There is a modest, non refundable, fixed fee to enroll in these plans each term, but no interest is charged during the payment term. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar&apos;s Office website.</p>
<h3 id="delinquent-payments">Delinquent Payments</h3>
<p>If all charges on a student&apos;s account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student&apos;s account and a hold will be placed on the student&apos;s account. A hold on a student&apos;s account prevents the release of diplomas or certificates, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default in accordance with California state law.</p>
<p>Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recovering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and reasonable attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University. Students with prior delinquent student accounts may be required to prepay for future enrollment.</p>
<h3 id="refunds-and-payment-policies">Refunds and Payment Policies</h3>
<p>Students may be eligible for a refund if they have a credit balance on their account. Refunds are processed after the add/drop period of each term/semester. Payment received by personal check will have a 14 calendar day hold before a refund can be issued. A 7 calendar day hold applies for electronic check payments. Refunds will not be processed for any overpayment on the account unless the student has completely withdrawn or dropped units causing a credit balance.</p>
<p>The University has partnered with A.W.G. Dewar, Inc. to provide a low-cost, tuition insurance protection plan. This plan protects students and their families against financial loss due to an unexpected complete withdrawal from the University, for diagnosed medical or mental health reasons. Santa Clara will charge the tuition insurance plan quarterly to the student&apos;s account. Students can choose to opt-out of the tuition insurance plan by completing a waiver on the Dewar website prior to the first day of the academic quarter. Information on the waiver and tuition insurance plan is available on the Bursar&apos;s Office website.</p>
<h3 id="billing-disputes">Billing Disputes</h3>
<p>If a student wishes to dispute any charge on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar&apos;s Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar&apos;s Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the disputed charge appeared. Communication can be made by telephone, but doing so will not preserve the student&apos;s rights.</p>
<p>Communication should include the student&apos;s name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress. However, all other charges need to be paid by the payment deadlines. If the disputed amount is deemed to be invalid, then an adjustment will be made on the student&apos;s account. If the amount in question is found to be valid, payment must be submitted to the Bursar&apos;s Office immediately upon notification.</p>
