<p>Bioengineering is the fastest-growing segment of engineering today and holds the promise of improving the lives of all people in very direct and diverse ways. Bioengineering focuses on the application of biological, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and other engineering principles to understand, modify, or control biological systems, and educates students to solve problems at the interface of engineering and the life sciences.</p>
<p>The major in bioengineering is designed to prepare students for careers in the medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, graduate study in bioengineering, or entry into medical school.</p>
<p>The bioengineering minor is primarily designed for those students who are interested in the field but are majoring in other disciplines, particularly science majors, students completing prerequisites for medical school as part of their undergraduate degree, or engineering majors.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major">Requirements for the Major</h2>
