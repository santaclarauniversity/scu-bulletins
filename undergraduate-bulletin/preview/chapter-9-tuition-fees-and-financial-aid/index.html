It is the student’s responsibility to be aware of their student account balance and financial aid information, and maintain current valid contact information at all times to ensure receipt of all University correspondence in a timely manner. All correspondence is sent from the University using the student’s official SCU email address. Students are responsible for checking their Santa Clara email address for important information and updates.</span></p><a id="id.hm8ib2wx5ywi"></a><h2 id="h.j598tskcoyi1"><span class=" gdbold">Financial Terms and Conditions</span></h2><p><span>Students are required to accept the financial terms and conditions outlined by the University in order to continue their enrollment at SCU. Students will be prompted to accept the terms and conditions, on an annual basis, upon their login to the Workday portal. Students must login to their Workday portal to read and agree to the Annual Online Agreement. By accepting SCU’s Annual Online Agreement, students are agreeing to pay and to abide by all policies and procedures as published.</span></p><a id="id.q2qibcmm9e0t"></a><h2 id="h.pcvgzjdf32tk"><span class=" gdbold">Billing and Payment Procedures</span></h2><a id="id.rxj01psisj32"></a><h3 id="h.qko9ywd1nsg3"><span class=" gdbold">Student Accounts and Billing</span></h3><p><span>Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures.</span></p><p><span>Students may designate a third party (e.g., parent, family member, spouse) to be an Authorized Payer for the purpose of reviewing student account/billing information and remitting payments on the student’s behalf. However, it is ultimately the student’s responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the published deadlines.</span></p><p><span>Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through the Workday portal. Billing notification will be sent to the student’s assigned SCU email inbox and to the email address of any Authorized Payer. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize. Information on a student’s account cannot be provided to any third-party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University.</span></p><p><span>Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees associated with their enrollment status by the published term payment deadline, regardless of receiving a billing statement. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to prepay for their enrollment. Registered students who do not withdraw formally from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their student account as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees.</span></p><a id="id.l8yhzhl5drsl"></a><h3 id="h.c7ig88mrru1w"><span class=" gdbold">Payment Methods</span></h3><p><span>Santa Clara University offers a variety of payment methods to students and their parents to assist with their financial obligations.</span></p><a id="id.3z7vedak6uso"></a><h3 id="h.2v7dp86sh5s3"><span class=" gdbold">Payment by Electronic Check</span></h3><p><span>A student or Authorized Payer may make online payments by authorizing a fund transfer directly from their personal checking or savings account through a third-party website accessible via the Workday portal. The payer is able to make electronic check payments online without incurring a transaction fee. Payments made by electronic check will be subjected to a 7-day calendar hold.</span></p><a id="id.8qoghrbkc0l5"></a><h3 id="h.j1w8adltws6j"><span class=" gdbold">Payment by Mail</span></h3><p><span>Payments for student account charges are accepted by mail. The payer should download a copy of the student’s billing statement, enclose it with a personal or cashier’s check payable to “Santa Clara University,” and mail both items to: SCU Payment Processing, P.O. Box 550, Santa Clara, CA 95052-0550. Payments made by paper check will be subjected to a 10-day calendar hold.</span></p><a id="id.pgr41d71uqma"></a><h3 id="h.csd2mawb50ra"><span class=" gdbold">Payment in Person</span></h3><p><span>Payments for student account charges may be made in person by check only at the OneStop Office located in the Admissions and Enrollment Services Building. Payments made by paper check will be subjected to a 10-day calendar hold. The OneStop Office is not able to initiate any form of electronic payment. However, there are computer kiosks located in the OneStop Office for the convenience of students and their payers who wish to make electronic payments. The University does not accept credit cards as payment for student account charges. </span></p><p><span>Payments made by guaranteed funds are not subject to holds.</span></p><a id="id.w6hf8yxayu9v"></a><h3 id="h.2vdji1hlq581"><span class=" gdbold">Extended Payment Options</span></h3><p><span>For students and their families wishing to spread payments over a period of time, the University offers term payment plans, which are available through the online billing system via Workday portal or Authorized Payer Transact portal. There is a $40.00 non-refundable, fixed fee to enroll in these plans each term, but no interest is charged during the payment term. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar’s Office website.</span></p><a id="id.8vg308kr89y9"></a><h3 id="h.6vvwwa9whanq"><span class=" gdbold">Delinquent and Late Payments</span></h3><p><span>If by the due date, all charges on a student’s account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student’s account and an account hold will be placed on the student’s account. The institution reserves the right to also require students with repeated instances of late payments to prepay for future enrollment.  If a student's prior-term payment history shows at least 2 consecutive terms of late payments, a registration hold may be placed on the account that would require prepayment with guaranteed for a minimum of three consecutive terms before pre-payment registration hold is lifted. A hold on a student’s account prevents the release of diplomas or certificates, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University.</span></p><p><span>Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recovering the debt owed to the University. All unpaid balances referred to an outside collection agency will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default in accordance with California state law. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and reasonable attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University. Returning students whose balances were previously referred[RS1]  to an external collection agency due to a delinquent account will be required to prepay for future enrollment.</span></p><a id="id.o2u7lrco3vsr"></a><h3 id="h.4bwvaw4xr77s"><span class=" gdbold">Refunds and Payment Policies</span></h3><p><span>Students may be eligible for a refund if they have a credit balance on their student account. Refunds are processed after the end of the add/drop period of each term/semester. Payments [RS2] made are subject to the holds as outlined within the “Payment Methods” above before refunds can be issued. Refunds will not be processed for any overpayment on the account unless the student has completely withdrawn or dropped units causing a credit balance.</span></p><a id="id.62toeldapyov"></a><h3 id="h.qvvi36m9czwp"><span class=" gdbold">Dewars Tuition Insurance Protection Plan</span></h3><p><span>The University has partnered with A.W.G. Dewar, Inc. to provide a low-cost, tuition insurance protection plan. This plan protects students and their families against financial loss due to an unexpected complete withdrawal from the University, for diagnosed medical or mental health reasons. Santa Clara will charge for the tuition insurance protection plan quarterly for fall, winter and spring to the student’s account. Students can choose to opt-out of the tuition insurance plan by completing a waiver on the Dewar website. </span><span class=" gdbold"> Your enrollment in the plan does not automatically cover summer sessions. </span><span>It is highly recommended that students</span><span class=" gdbold"> </span><span>purchase tuition insurance coverage for summer sessions. </span><span class=" gdbold">If you wish to purchase coverage for summer sessions, please contact Dewar directly at trp@dewarinsurance.com or 617-774-1555.</span></p><p><span>All full-time undergraduate students are automatically enrolled in the Tuition Insurance Protection Plan. Graduate students wishing to purchase the insurance in any term can do so by contacting Dewars directly at trp@dewarinsurance.com or 617-774-1555.</span><span class=" gdbold"> </span><span>Students who do not wish to participate in the Plan can opt-out by waiving the coverage for </span><span>fall, winter and spring, </span><span> prior to the start of their first term in the academic year. </span><span> </span><span>The deadline to opt-out of the plan is the Sunday before the start of the term. </span><span>For students who remain enrolled in the Plan, the quarterly premium charge will appear on the fall, winter, and spring billing statements</span><span>[RS4] </span><span>. </span><span>The tuition insurance protection plan covers 80% of the student’s out of pocket tuition costs for diagnosed medical and mental health related withdrawals that occur after the first week of the term.

Qualifying hardships include (1) death, disabling injury, medical emergency, or loss of job of the parent or guardian of a dependent student; (2) loss of job by an independent student; (3) medical or other emergency involving a dependent of an independent student; and (4) deployment for active military duty of a student. The vice provost for student life or designee, in consultation with the Financial Aid Office, will determine qualifying hardships and any allocation from the student hardship fund. Students must submit a request for reconsideration of tuition charges or for an allocation from the student hardship fund not later than 90 days from the end of that term.</span></p><a id="id.gh62iyvaj18u"></a><h3 id="h.m196d3qg5szb"><span class=" gdbold">Billing Disputes</span></h3><p><span>If a student wishes to dispute any charge on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar’s Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar’s Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the disputed charge appeared.</span></p><p><span>Communication should include the student’s name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress. However, all other charges need to be paid by the payment deadlines. If the disputed amount is deemed to be invalid, then an adjustment will be made on the student’s account. If the amount in question is found to be valid, payment must be submitted to the Bursar’s Office immediately upon notification.</span></p><a id="id.bpd237vn12q6"></a><h2 id="h.916v74ganjr2"><span class=" gdbold">Tuition</span></h2><p><span>The Board of Trustees, upon the recommendation of the President and the Provost, sets the annual academic year tuition rate and the summer sessions tuition rate for the undergraduate program. The full-time quarterly tuition rate for fall, winter, and spring terms is set at one-third of the annual tuition rate. The part-time, per-unit tuition rate for fall, winter, and spring terms is set at one-twelfth of the quarterly tuition rate. The summer sessions tuition rate is set at a percentage of the per-unit tuition rate for the preceding academic year. The Young Scholars tuition rate is set at a percentage of the per-unit tuition rate from the preceding academic year. See the tuition and fee schedule for details. </span></p><a id="id.ogr95c1axzv"></a><h2 id="h.ulsfehvk7q0t"><span class=" gdbold">Housing and Dining  Charges</span></h2><p><span>The Board of Trustees, upon the recommendation of the President and the Vice President for Administration and Finance, sets housing and dining charges for undergraduate student housing. Rates for specific types of accommodations and meal plans are available from the Housing Office. Students sign a University Housing Contract for a full academic year or, if entering housing mid-year, for the remainder of the academic year.

Once those degree requirements have been met and a student is eligible to graduate, he or she is no longer entitled to receive aid. This holds true even if the student has been here fewer than 12 academic quarters.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Students who are able to graduate because they have completed all of their degree requirements but </span><span class=" gdbold">decide to enroll for an additional term,</span><span> are not eligible to receive federal, state, or University-funded aid for the additional term. Students who believe that they may be </span><span>adversely </span><span>impacted by the U.S Department of Education regulations should reach out to a financial aid counselor to discuss their particular circumstances. </span></p><p><span class=" gdbold"></span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Academic Standing and Satisfactory Progress Requirements</span></p><p><span>All financial aid recipients must maintain good academic standing and be making satisfactory progress toward a degree according to the University standards and applicable federal and state regulations. Students are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress each quarter.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Qualitatively</span></p><p><span>Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. Note: Some Santa Clara University aid programs require a higher cumulative grade point average than the federal minimum requirement.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Quantitatively</span></p><p><span>Students must maintain a cumulative </span><span>67 </span><span>percent completion rate for all units attempted toward their academic programs.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Maximum Attempted Units Allowed</span></p><p><span>Students must complete the requirements for their academic programs within 150 percent of the minimum units required to complete their academic programs. Units attempted also include all units transferred into Santa Clara University from prior institutions that can be used to satisfy students’ academic program requirements. Students who have reached their maximum attempted units allowed are ineligible for additional financial aid. Students may appeal for financial aid probation status if they feel their circumstances warrant an exception to this standard.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Unit Requirements</span></p><p><span>All financial aid recipients must register for and maintain a full course load of 12 units or more per quarter, if the aid was awarded on this basis. Students who drop below 12 units may see their financial aid adjusted. Full-time and part-time status is defined as follows:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_5-0 start"><li><span>Full-time: 12 or more units</span></li><li><span>Three-fourths time: 9 to 11 units</span></li><li><span>Half-time: 6 to 8 units</span></li><li><span>Less than half-time: fewer than 6 units</span></li></ul><p><span class=" gdbold">Course Incompletes, Withdrawal, Failures, and/or Repetitions</span></p><p><span>Incompletes (I), Withdrawals (W), Failures (F), and/or repeated courses will adversely affect a student’s completion rate. Students must complete the minimum number of units to fulfill federal, state, and University requirements. Completion rates are calculated cumulatively and will include all quarters that the student was enrolled, whether or not the student received financial aid.</span></p><p><span>Students who wish to withdraw from Santa Clara University during a quarter must complete a withdrawal form and an exit interview in the Drahmann Advising and Learning Resource Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student’s registration will be canceled without academic penalty. A withdrawal notation (W) will be assigned for each course from which the student withdraws after the fourth week of the quarter. Students who leave Santa Clara University during a quarter without formally withdrawing are subject to failing grades in all courses in which they were registered and are ineligible for refund of </span><span>tuition</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>IMPORTANT: Any student leaving Santa Clara University at the conclusion of any quarter should also complete the standard withdrawal process.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Repetition of Courses</span></p><p><span>Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than C minus (C-). In such cases, </span><span>the highest grade for the repeated course will be used in the GPA calculation. This “best attempt” policy is in keeping with best practices and will apply to the calculation of both overall GPA and major GPA. Units will still be awarded only once for the course, and grades for all attempts will remain on the student’s transcript.</span><span> Certain courses, such as special topics courses and performance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Evaluation</span></p><p><span>All students enrolled at Santa Clara University are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress at the end of each quarter after the Office of Registrar has released official grades.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Appeal Process</span></p><p><span>There may be extenuating circumstances encountered by a student that affect his/her ability to be academically successful during an enrollment period. These circumstances include personal injury or illness that occurs during an enrollment period; death of an immediate family member or legal guardian during an enrollment period; or other documented circumstances that were unexpected in nature and beyond control of the student. In these cases, cumulative grade point average or completion rate may decline resulting in the student not meeting the minimum qualitative and quantitative standards previously described. If the student wishes to appeal the suspension from financial aid eligibility, a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal form must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office. If the appeal is approved, s/he will be placed on financial aid probation (separate from academic probation). Students will be notified of the appeal results in writing.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Loss of Eligibility</span></p><p><span>A student who has lost eligibility to participate in federal, state, and University aid programs for reasons of academic progress can regain that eligibility only by enrolling at Santa Clara University at his/her own expense. The mere passage of time will not restore eligibility to a student who has lost eligibility for failure to make satisfactory academic progress. Students who have been dismissed from Santa Clara University for academic reasons, but who are subsequently readmitted are not automatically eligible to participate in federal, state, or institutional aid programs and will be placed on financial aid warning. Re-admission decisions are separate from funding decisions.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Regaining Eligibility</span></p><p><span>Students who </span><span>fail</span><span> to meet satisfactory academic progress and who choose to enroll without financial aid may request a review of their academic record after any term in which they are enrolled without the receipt of financial aid. If the standards are met at the time of review, eligibility may be regained for subsequent terms of enrollment in the academic year.</span></p><a id="id.35nkun2"></a><h2><span class=" gdbold">Other Program Eligibility</span></h2><h2><span class=" gdbold">Study Abroad and Global Programs</span></h2><p><span>Santa Clara University students participating in study abroad and domestic public sector study programs operated by or affiliated with the University are eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid and tuition remission as well as federal and state aid consistent with the policies and practices applicable to students enrolled for on-campus classes. Tuition and housing and food rates associated with the specific program will be factored into the determination of the financial aid consistent with applicable policies and practices. The total amount of tuition remission for the academic year cannot exceed the annual tuition rate for that year. Students with private scholarships should contact the donor for prior approval to use funds for study abroad or domestic study programs. Students from other colleges and universities enrolled in Santa Clara University study abroad programs are not eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Veterans and Veterans’ Dependents Assistance</span></p><p><span>Santa Clara University has been certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 percent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill®), Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®), and Yellow Ribbon. Individuals interested in attending under any of the veteran assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar.</span></p><p><span>GI Bill® is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at</span><span><a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill"> http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill</a></span><span>. </span></p><a id="id.1ksv4uv"></a><h2><span class=" gdbold">Cancellation of Financial Aid and Return of Funds</span></h2><p><span>Students who withdraw (officially or unofficially) from the University and who have federal financial aid are subject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds (R2T4). This R2T4 regulation is based on EARNED and UNEARNED aid at the time of total withdrawal from all classes for a term. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time the student remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal financial aid funds governed under Title IV other than those earned under the college work-study program.</span></p><p><span>Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time the student remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. Please note this policy is separate and distinct from the Santa Clara University credit balance refund policy </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.scu.edu/bursar/refund/">https://www.scu.edu/bursar/refund/</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to state or University financial aid programs or to the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received Federal Title IV assistance:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_6-0 start"><li><span>Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans)</span></li><li><span>Subsidized Federal Direct Loans</span></li><li><span>Federal Direct PLUS Loans</span></li><li><span>Federal Pell Grants for which a return is required</span></li><li><span>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants for which a return is required</span></li><li><span>TEACH Grants for which a return is required</span></li><li><span>Iraq and Afghanistan Grants for which a return is required</span></li></ul><a id="id.44sinio"></a><h2><span class=" gdbold">Student Verification of Information</span></h2><p><span>The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students and their families submit as a basis for the aid. Each year, a percentage of students receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the information on which their financial aid was based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request </span><span>additional </span><span>information for verification purposes for any student offered aid and to verify the attendance of other children in college. </span><span>When verified information differs from that originally submitted, it</span><span> may result in changes to </span><span>aid eligibility. </span><span> In some cases, this may result in the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for</span><span> additional</span><span> information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds.</span></p><p><span></span></p></body>
