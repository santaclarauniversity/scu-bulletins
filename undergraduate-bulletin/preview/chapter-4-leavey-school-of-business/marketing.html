Marketing links a business to its markets and customers and acts as the eyes and ears for a firm, helping managers to identify emerging market opportunities and anticipating customer needs and wants.

Finally, strategic marketing addresses competitive threats and opportunities, guiding a firm’s efforts to deliver superior value. Because customer analysis and competitive advantage are crucial to business success, a degree in marketing provides a solid foundation for a general management career leading to executive responsibilities. It can also provide the basis for a more focused career in advertising, retailing, sales, brand management, and market research.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2><span class=" gdbold">Requirements for the Major</span></h2><p><span>In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum and Leavey School of Business requirements for the bachelor of science in commerce degree, students majoring in marketing must complete the following departmental requirements:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_fekmuvuavxql-0 start"><li><span>MKTG 182 and 183 (recommended to be completed in junior year, prior to electives)</span></li><li><span>Three elective courses in marketing must be completed.</span></li></ul><p><span>The following emphases have been created to inform students of recommended classes to take should they want to explore an emphasis area. </span></p><p><span>The emphasis areas: (a) Business and Technology and (b) Consumer and Channel.
