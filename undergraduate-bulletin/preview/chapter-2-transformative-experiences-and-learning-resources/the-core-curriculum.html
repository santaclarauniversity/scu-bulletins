          <hr> <body class="doc-content"><a id="id.gjdgxs"></a><h1><span class=" gdbold">The Core Curriculum</span></h1><p><span>The Core Curriculum is a set of general education requirements that apply to all undergraduate students at Santa Clara University. </span></p><p><span>The goal of the Core Curriculum is to help students achieve a holistic Jesuit education that is built on three central learning goals: Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World. In this way, the Core is a critical component of the mission, vision, and values of SCU.</span></p><p><span>Santa Clara’s Core Curriculum explicitly integrates three traditions of higher education. As a Catholic university, it is rooted in the tradition of pursuing an understanding of God through the free exercise of reason. As a Jesuit university, it promotes a humanistic education that leads toward ethical engagement with the world. As a comprehensive American university committed to liberal education, Santa Clara seeks to prepare its students for intelligent, responsible, and creative citizenship. Reflecting these traditions, the Core Curriculum provides every undergraduate with the common learning that all students need to become leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion.</span></p><p><span>The distinctiveness of a Santa Clara education emerges in the Core Curriculum, both in its sense of purpose rooted in the University’s traditions and in its commitment to a breadth of learning for the 21st century that complements and supports all majors. The Core Curriculum opens students to the study and practice of the arts, humanities, mathematics, technology, natural sciences, and social sciences. It educates students for interdisciplinary understanding and ethically informed participation in civic life.</span></p><p><span>Opportunities for experiential learning foster the development of compassion and attention to the ways human suffering can be alleviated. Reflecting the University’s founding mission, the Core Curriculum includes a disciplined and critical reflection on the religious dimensions of human existence. In addition, because the Core Curriculum continually highlights the critical and compelling questions facing individuals and communities, the Core Curriculum supports students both in making professional career choices and in discerning their larger vocation</span><span>—</span><span>their life’s purpose in the world.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2><span class=" gdbold">Learning Goals: What will students learn in the Core Curriculum?</span></h2><p><span>Because a liberal education in the Jesuit tradition is oriented toward particular ends, the Core Curriculum affirms a set of central learning goals. These goals are divided among three broad categories</span><span>: </span><span>Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World.</span></p><a id="id.1fob9te"></a><h3><span class=" gdbold">Knowledge</span></h3><p><span>To be prepared for well-informed engagement in society, students must comprehend the forces that have shaped the world they have inherited and the ways the world is interpreted and understood. They must also understand how they might transform the world for the better. The Core Curriculum deepens students’ knowledge of the ideas and ways of knowing that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Global Cultures:</span><span> The intertwined development of global ideas, institutions, religions, and cultures, including Western cultures</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Arts and Humanities:</span><span> The production, interpretation, and social influence of the fine and performing arts, history, languages, literatures, philosophy, and religion</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Scientific Inquiry:</span><span> The principles of scientific inquiry and how they are applied in the natural and social sciences</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Science and Technology:</span><span> The formative influences, dynamics, social impacts, and ethical consequences of scientific and technological development</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Diversity:</span><span> Diverse human experiences, identities, and cultures within local and global societies, especially as formed by relations of power and privilege</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Civic Life:</span><span> The roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens and institutions in societies and in the world</span></p><a id="id.3znysh7"></a><h3><span class=" gdbold">Habits of Mind and Heart</span></h3><p><span>To contribute to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world, students must develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that allow them to educate themselves for the rest of their lives with passion and purpose. By attending to the cognitive and affective dimensions of human experience, the Core Curriculum enables students to think more deeply, imagine more freely, and communicate more clearly.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Critical Thinking:</span><span> The ability to identify, reflect upon, evaluate, integrate, and apply different types of information and knowledge to form independent judgments</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Mathematics and Quantitative Reasoning:</span><span> Analytical and logical thinking and the habit of drawing conclusions based on quantitative information</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Complexity:</span><span> An approach to understanding the world that appreciates ambiguity and nuance as well as clarity and precision</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Ethical Reasoning:</span><span> Drawing on ethical traditions to assess the consequences of individual and institutional decisions</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Religious Reflection:</span><span> Questioning and clarifying beliefs through critical inquiry into faith and the religious dimensions of human existence</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Communication:</span><span> Interacting effectively with different audiences, especially through writing, speech, and a second language</span></p><a id="id.2et92p0"></a><h3><span class=" gdbold">Engagement with the World</span></h3><p><span>To engage with the world in meaningful ways, students need opportunities to explore and refine self-knowledge in relation to others. The Core Curriculum enhances students’ understanding of the integrity of their own lives and the dignity inherent in the lives of others, especially the impoverished, suffering, and marginalized.</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Perspective:</span><span> Seeking out the experience of different cultures and people, striving to view the world through their eyes</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Collaboration:</span><span> The capacity to collaborate intellectually and creatively with diverse people</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Social Justice:</span><span> Developing a disciplined sensibility toward the causes of human suffering and misery, and a sense of responsibility for addressing them</span></p><p><span class=" gdbold">Civic Engagement:</span><span> Addressing major contemporary social issues, including environmental sustainability and peaceful resolution of conflict, by participating actively as an informed citizen of society and the world</span></p><p><span>Each course in th</span><span>e Core Curriculum addresses at least three of the learning goals listed above. Students have multiple opportunities to encounter, practice, and master each learning goal. In addition, specific learning objectives for each area of the Core Curriculum have been developed by faculty Core Curriculum committees. These learning objectives are associated with particular learning goals and describe the knowledge, skills, and values students will be able to demonstrate after completing the courses in the Core Curriculum. The learning objectives are posted on the Core Curriculum website</span><span>.</span></p><a id="id.45nasmdtvgrg"></a><h2 id="h.c6if7vrrmpqy"><span>Structure of the Core Curriculum</span></h2><p><span>The structure o</span><span>f the Core features</span><span> </span><span>three </span><span>phases designed to foster developmental learning and curricular coherence. The first phase, </span><span class=" gditalic">Foundations,</span><span> consists of courses normally taken in the first year, introducing students to the processes and expectations for university-level education:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_grvs076mox4c-0 start"><li><span>Critical Thinking &amp; Writing 1 and 2</span></li><li><span>Cultures &amp; Ideas 1 and 2</span></li><li><span>Second Language (level required varies by major) </span></li><li><span>Mathematics </span></li><li><span>Religion, Theology &amp; Culture 1</span></li></ul><p><span>This phase helps students begin to set their own goals for learning, preparing them to make thoughtful choices in the Core Curriculum, their majors, and cocurricular activities.</span></p><p><span>The second phase, </span><span class=" gditalic">Explorations</span><span>, offers students the opportunity to choose among courses that will expand and deepen their understanding of a broad range of subject areas needed for effective participation in contemporary life</span><span> as well as satisfy requirements in students’ majors</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span class=" gditalic">Explorations</span><span> requirements</span><span>:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_crqulzltntqz-0 start"><li><span>Ethics</span></li><li><span>Civic Engagement</span></li><li><span>Diversity: U.S. Perspectives</span></li><li><span>Arts</span></li><li><span>Social Science</span></li><li><span>Natural Science</span></li><li><span>Science, Technology &amp; Society</span></li><li><span>Cultures &amp; Ideas 3</span></li><li><span>Religion, Theology &amp; Culture 2</span></li><li><span>Religion, Theology &amp; Culture 3</span></li></ul><p><span>Students in Arts and Sciences and Business satisfy their Core </span><span class=" gditalic">Foundations</span><span> and </span><span class=" gditalic">Explorations</span><span> requirements with one course per Core area.

Furthermore, the </span><span class=" gditalic">Integrations</span><span> components of the Core Curriculum help students experience requirements not only as individual courses but as related educational activities that help structure and integrate their entire experience of </span><span>U</span><span>niversity study.</span></p><p><span>The </span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/">Core </a></span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/">Curriculum</a></span><span class=" gditalic gduline"><a href="https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/"> </a></span><span class=" gduline"><a href="https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/">website</a></span><span> </span><span>provides more detailed information about each component of the Core Curriculum, the learning goals and objectives associated with each component, the core policies, and the courses from which students may choose.
