Texting God</span></h3><p><span>This course explores how people express their beliefs and how the technologies they use shape what they say. Focusing on Jewish and Christian “texts” (oral, written, visual, gesture), we’ll examine the core beliefs that communities inscribe in them. We’ll also consider how scriptural memes are reconstructed in the ongoing process of building cultural memory. We’ll learn to analyze the rhetoric of various modes, and ask how changing technologies are altering our experience of text, scripture, and our relationships with God. (4 units)</span></p><a id="id.3dy6vkm"></a><h3><span class=" gdbold">19. Religions of the Book</span></h3><p><span>This course offers an introduction to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam with a study of their central texts, traditions and practices. We begin the course with a paradox: religion, that which in its literal sense “binds” or “fastens together,” is also that which often violently divides our world. As we examine the sacred texts of Jews, Christians, and Muslims (Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran), and various methods of interpreting them, our focus will remain on what is shared and what characteristically distinguishes between the monotheistic faiths. (4 units)</span></p><a id="id.1t3h5sf"></a><h3><span class=" gdbold">26. Gender in Early Christianity</span></h3><p><span>The history of early Christianity is often portrayed as a history of, by, and about men, despite clear indications that women played a prominent role in the early church. Introduces the construction of gender in antiquity, Jewish and Greco-Roman laws and customs, the biblical canon, and other Christian texts. Contemporary feminist perspectives will inform the discussion. Also listed as GNSX 46. (4 units)</span></p><a id="id.4d34og8"></a><h3><span class=" gdbold">27. Digging Up Jesus</span></h3><p><span>This course examines the archaeological and literary evidence for Jesus. We’ll use these primary “texts” to reconstruct the most plausible context for Jesus’ work so that we can better understand the </span><span>G</span><span>ospel message, and learn the criteria for assessing whether he really said and did what the </span><span>G</span><span>ospels report. We’ll also try to appreciate what the </span><span>G</span><span>ospel authors were doing in translating Jesus for their communities, just as we are doing ourselves with the historical approach of the course. (4 units)</span></p><a id="id.2s8eyo1"></a><h3><span>28. Sex &amp; Power: Gender </span><span>In</span><span> in</span><span> the Hebrew Bible</span></h3><p><span>This course explores stores, tropes, metaphors, poetry, and archaeology related to Hebrew Bible and Old Testament (HB/OT) women. Biblical studies methodologies and interdisciplinary lenses will be used to create access points with the material culture of the Ancient Near East (ANE), literary life and afterlives of biblical texts, as well as intersectional juxtapositions between ANE and contemporary lives of women. We will explore questions such as: Did God have a wife? Are the oldest parts of the HB/OT written by women? How many different ways can families be defined? How does the HB/OT promote leadership and women? </span><span>Also listed as GNSX 21. </span><span>(4 units)</span></p><a id="id.26in1rg"></a><h3><span class=" gdbold">39. Biblical Women and Power</span></h3><p><span>Hero, villain, prophet, deviant</span><span>—</span><span>these are some of the power roles embodied by women in the Bible. Explores the exercise of power by biblical women in actual and figurative situations, in culturally positive and negative ways. Attention will be given to the continuing impact of such traditions for gender socialization in our world today. Also listed as </span><span>GNSX 4</span><span>7. (4 units)</span></p><a id="id.lnxbz9"></a><h3><span class=" gdbold">48. Racializing Jesus</span></h3><p><span>The course explores the various ancient and contemporary ethnic representations of Jesus in art, film, regalia, and scripture. Although portraits of Jesus as a white, blue-eyed prophet, messiah, or rabbi haunt the popular cultural imagination, these often reflect the social location and racial biases of Western scholars. But, what if Jesus was black, non-white Latin</span><span>x</span><span>, Amerindian, Asian, or Jewish? And, why is contemporary scholarship still grappling with the idea of Jewish messiah? In order to map the politics of interpretation and presentation, the course seeks to “radicalize” Jesus by (1) exploring his Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (2) critically engaging sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; (3) interrogation of the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship; and (4) mapping the implications for marginalized ethnic communities and interracial dialogue. Key themes to explore include: </span><span>r</span><span>ace/ethnicity, </span><span>c</span><span>olonialism and </span><span>i</span><span>mperialism, the quests for </span><span>h</span><span>istorical Jesus, Hitler’s Third Reich, </span><span>e</span><span>ugenics, </span><span>i</span><span>nterreligious </span><span>d</span><span>ialogue, police violence (Ferguson &amp; Baltimore), and the polemic over Jesus’ wife.

Bible and Ecology</span></h3><p><span>The Christian tradition has long been known for its anthropocentrism (human-centeredness), and traditional interpretations of the Bible have perpetuated the idea that God made the universe for humans, leaving other creatures to struggle amid both evolutionary forces and devastating human actions. What does the Bible really “say” about creation? What is the ethical significance of Jewish and Christian perspectives on the natural world, given our planet’s threatened state? (5 units)</span></p><a id="id.z337ya"></a><h3><span class=" gdbold">112. Martyrdom</span></h3><p><span>This course interrogates the role of sacred texts in legitimizing contemporary discourses on martyrdom or “Dying </span><span>i</span><span>n God.” Crucial questions to explore include: What is martyrdom and its relationship to ancient notions of noble death? Why are notions of martyrdom so prevalent amongst Christian, Jewish, and Muslim fundamentalist groups today? How is the Torah, the Bible, and the Quran used to legitimate violence against the self and others? Key themes to explore include: notions of a noble death in antiquity, imperial violence (</span><span>c</span><span>rucifixion), the book of Revelation, martyrdom in </span><span>e</span><span>arly Christianity, the Crusades, Jonestown, Branch Davidians, </span><span>s</span><span>ecularization, </span><span>f</span><span>undamentalism (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim), suicide bombing, school shootings, and the rise of the Islamic State.

The Bible and Migration</span></h3><p><span>This course explores the current migration crisis at the U.S/Mexico borderlands and concomitant motivations, tensions, dilemmas, and perils of the migration journey. As the current migrant caravans at the U.S./Mexico border show, the planet is experiencing massive displacement of persons as a result of climate change, economic hardships, political unrest, wars, cartel violence, and neocolonialism. In their quest for human survival and freedom, migrants face religious intolerance, racism, exploitation and exclusion. Drawing from various scriptural, theological, ethical, sociological and anthropological approaches, this course equips students with a constructive pastoral response to the migrant crisis at home and abroad and challenges them to put a human face to the migrant other. Engaging a lecture-seminar format, the course will include films, guest speakers, and a visit to migrant communities, and deportations centers, and the U.S./Mexico border. Students will collaborate with local and international organizations (e.g. PICO, the Kino Border Initiative, and Pueblo Sin Fronteras) that work for migrant rights and well-being.

Apocalypse Now</span></h3><p><span>This course provides a comparative introduction to ideas/symbols/theologies of the “End of the World” in three major monotheistic religions. In view of the influence of apocalyptic thought upon contemporary American culture in particular, and Western and non-Western societies in general, this course prepares students to responsibly engage in discussions of </span><span>“</span><span>End of the World</span><span>”</span><span> scenarios and their religious, socioeconomic, political implications. Themes germane to the course include: colonialism, environmental disasters (e.g., Pentecostalism), and alternative religious violence (e.g., Jonestown). In order to help students explore and articulate these themes, the course will provide various interpretive approaches from the theories and methods in the study of religion. We conclude the course by reflecting on the influence of apocalyptic thought upon our own spirituality, hopes, and religious traditions.

From Babylon To Birmingham</span></h3><p><span>This course examines the role of prophets and prophecy in diagnosing social, theological, and political problems and instigating calls for justice and social change. Beginning with texts from the Hebrew Bible and Mesopotamia, this course will introduce students to the variety of ways humans have sought to decipher the will of the gods (through dream interpretation, omens, extispicy, and visions) as well as to complex rules which governed prophetic and interpretive activity. We will focus on figures like Moses, Isaiah, Amos, and Habakkuk to develop our paradigm of prophecy. In the second half of the course, we will examine modern day American prophets like Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day, and Abraham Joshua Heschel, looking for points of continuity and discontinuity from the framework developed from our readings of biblical texts.

What purpose does it serve Israelite kings to cut the trees, salt the fields, and destroy grain houses of their enemies? Are there laws which govern the conduct of armies at war? Drawing on texts like Deuteronomy 20, which outlines acceptable practices during war, as well as Neo-Babylonian and Assyrian omen texts, historical inscriptions, and iconographic reliefs, this course will introduce students to the strategies of war in regards to the built and natural environment in the Hebrew Bible and ancient Near East. We will also examine how gods, such as Yahweh, Adad, and Ishtar, are mobilized in battle to aid in the defeat of one’s enemies. Towards the end of the course, we will also consider the afterlife of these ancient texts as they are codified into modern law such as the Geneva and Hague Conventions about stewardship of the environment during times of war.

How does flood imagery function in the film Day After Tomorrow? How do climate concerns show up in literature? From Genesis to the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Rig Veda to modern novels like Jeanette Winterson's Boating for Beginners (1997), humans have repeatedly accounted for, imagined, ironized, and threatened civilizational collapse (and restoration) through geo-mythological stories of catastrophic floods. These texts, both modern and ancient, are fraught with political, religious, and historical background. In this course, we will ask how sacred and secular imaginings of a deluge are productive and generative, while being attuned to the complex differences between the ancient narratives and their significantly different modern afterlives.

Why is he gendered male, with only a few notable exceptions like the birthing woman in Isaiah 42? What are the contours of the covenant relationships between Yahweh, Israel, and Judah? The tension between the many theological ideas about God offers a complex set of perspectives on Yahweh, kingship, Jerusalem, and the future of Judah. In this course, we will examine the depiction of the deity in the Hebrew Bible as a window onto the ancient Israelite religious imagination. In so doing, we will also attend to the ancient  Near Eastern ideas about divinity particularly in the portrayal of deities as divine rulers. Towards the end of the course, we will examine the afterlives of the Hebrew Bible’s competing portrayals of Yahweh  as they are brought to bear on meaning-making after catastrophe in modernity.

Can it be understood? Or should it merely be recognized? Most centrally, the question arises: what is the relationship between good, especially God, and evil? Should we hope? Can we? Is hell stronger than heaven? Does fire burn hotter than love? This is a text-driven course, built around “primary sources,” mainly of a historical nature.

This course examines several contemporary social issues using the lenses of Christian theology and ethics, with a particular emphasis on Catholic Social Teaching. We will examine themes such as human dignity and human rights, the common good, economic justice, sin, solidarity, and a preferential option for the poor. In light of these themes, the course invites students to assess responses to various social topics, such as U.S. immigration, racism and civil rights, capital punishment, and state-sanctioned medically-assisted death.

Conflict and Common Good Ethics</span></h3><p><span>The idea that society's members share a "common good," and that it is the responsibility of politics--and, indeed, all members of society--to promote it, is central to many religious and ethical traditions. It is especially central, perhaps, to the Catholic tradition, in which the common good features as a core principle of social ethics. But what does the ideal of the common good mean in highly pluralistic, fragmented, and, increasingly, conflictual societies, such as the contemporary United States? Can a society even be said to have a common good if its members radically disagree on what that common good is? And how is it possible, in practice, to promote the common good in the midst of difference, polarization, and conflict? This course will explore these and other key questions about the common good today, drawing on resources from Christian (and especially Catholic) social ethics and secular moral and political thought. It will also use the common good as a primary lens through which to consider some of the major challenges facing contemporary societies, primarily but not limited to the U.S. (5 units)</span></p><a id="id.25b2l0r"></a><h3><span class=" gdbold">183.

The Science of Religion</span></h3><p><span>This course introduces students to foundational questions concerning the nature and functions of religion in human life, drawing on scientific research from fields such as cultural anthropology, cognitive neuroscience, computer science, cultural evolutionary science, evolutionary psychology, sociology, and theology. We will explore how religion contributes to human experience in practical ways that enhance the odds of species survival and thriving. The course considers religion as a natural human phenomenon that can be understood with particular depth, complexity, and nuance by applying the tools of science. Nonetheless, we will also reflect on the limitations of strictly empirical approaches to the study of religion.</span><span> [5 units]</span></p><a id="kix.lqvq6aa8yw5s"></a><h3 id="h.gvxjg05tyx48"><span>175. Mapping Living </span><span>Religion</span></h3><p><span></span></p><p><span>This course explores the intersection of geography, technology, religion, and culture in Silicon Valley. Through engagement with readings, lectures, discussions, and field visits, the course will introduce students to concepts and methods from cultural geography, sociology, and religious studies, using geographic information systems (GIS) to better understand the relationship between urban transformation and religious experience. We will examine how changes in the built and natural environment, such as are planned in the development of Google’s San Jose Transit Village Campus  and campus (“Googleville”), along with associated demographic shifts, change the religious and spiritual communities existing in the area designated for development. In turn, we will examine the extent to which religious communities have a role in shaping this transformation. The course will be of particular interest to students in anthropology, computer science, political science, religious studies, and sociology.
