Undergraduate study in the Department of Information Systems and Analytics (ISA) explores the use of computer information systems and analytical decision-making methods in organizations. Essential to the conduct of business, these skills equip the department's majors and minors to design, implement, and evaluate systems central to an organization's success.

In addition to the major in management information systems (MIS), the department offers an MIS minor for nonbusiness and non-MIS majors, the interdepartmental major of accounting and information systems (AIS), and the minor in business analytics for business students.

The department's majors and minors may pursue a variety of careers after graduation, including management consulting, systems administration, technical sales and marketing, operations management, and roles as business analysts in public, private, service, and nonprofit sectors. Past graduates have also gone on to various master's degree or doctoral programs, as well as law school.
