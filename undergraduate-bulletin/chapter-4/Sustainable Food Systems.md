**Sustainable Food Systems** 
============================

*Directors:* Gregory Baker and Erika French-Arnold

The Sustainable Food Systems minor provides students with the opportunity to explore the intersection of global food systems and sustainability. Courses address the cultural aspects of food, food policies, nutrition and public health, social justice, sustainability, and opportunities for creating new innovation and change within the food system. Seven courses are required to complete the minor. Two courses must be selected from each of three dimensions: cultural/societal, sustainable development, and innovation and change. A seventh course must be selected from a list of experiential learning courses. Only three courses from a student's major will count towards the Sustainable Food Systems minor. The minor will prepare students for future careers in food industry management, food entrepreneurship, food policy, public health, and nutrition.
