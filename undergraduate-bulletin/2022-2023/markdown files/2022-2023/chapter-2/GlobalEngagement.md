Global Engagement
=================

Global Engagement includes International Students and Scholars and Study Abroad. Global Engagement's mission is: To ignite curiosity and foster understanding about the world and SCU's place in it by connecting students, faculty and staff through teaching, learning and research. In keeping with that mission, Global Engagement provides leadership, strategy and resources that support global diversity and learning at the University. Global Engagement units include Study Abroad and International Students and Scholars. Programs and initiatives include: international partnerships, international programs, the Global Engagement Global Innovation Fellowship, the Global Community Engagement Fellowship, Global Internships, UK Fulbright Summer Programs, Virtual Global Internships, the International Studies Minor, and Faculty Fulbright grants. In addition, the Associate Provost for International Programs works with departments across the University to develop global partnerships and programs, as well as to support university-sponsored international travel.

Global Engagement admits non-degree international students participating in an approved international partnership program. Santa Clara does not have a part-time undergraduate program option and does not enroll non-degree students except through international partnership programs. International students participating in Santa Clara's non-degree Exchange and Visiting programs apply through Global Engagement. Applicants are expected to meet all prerequisites and requirements of the specific partnership. Non-degree Exchange/Visiting students may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and meet all prerequisites required of the exchange agreement. They are not eligible to audit classes.

International Students and Scholars
-----------------------------------

International Students and Scholars (ISS) is part of Global Engagement, which provides leadership, strategic planning, coordination, and resources for expanding intercultural and international initiatives across campus to enhance global diversity.

Santa Clara University provides support for international students including immigration advising on F-1 and J-1 visas, as well as intercultural and academic advising and career integration through academic internships and post-graduation employment. International Students and Scholars also supports international students in other visa categories who wish to change their status to F-1, and international students who are Global Nomads: U.S. passport holders living abroad.

As soon as international students confirm their attendance at SCU, International Students and Scholars : a) provides initial documents to help students obtain their visa to attend SCU; b) helps students prepare for travel and arrival to the US; and c) advises students on academic planning, planning for internships, and post-graduation employment.

All international students are required to participate in International Student Welcome (ISW), a mandatory orientation program for international students that supplements the new student orientation program. Global Engagement provides regular programming to support international student success. Examples of recent programming include immigration workshops, Employment Conference, the U.S. Cultural Conversations series, the iExchange program, and the international graduation reception.

Undergraduate non-degree international students are admitted to programs at the University through Global Engagement and should refer to complete information here:[https://www.scu.edu/globalengagement/international-students/non-degree-international-students/](https://www.scu.edu/globalengagement/international-students/non-degree-international-students/) and Chapter 8 on non-degree students..

International students considering withdrawing from the University should contact International Students and Scholars at [iss@scu.edu](mailto:iss@scu.edu) to discuss how withdrawing will impact their immigration status. See Chapter 8, *Withdrawal from the University*.

Study Abroad and Global Programs
--------------------------------

Santa Clara University provides students with opportunities to participate in a range of global study programs including: semester or quarter-length study abroad; Global Explorations short-term faculty-led programs; the Global Engagement Innovation Fellowship; the Global Engagement Community Engagement Fellowship; Global Internships; UK Summer Fulbright and Virtual Programs. Programs are available during four terms: summer, fall, winter, and spring.

Santa Clara approved programs offer students opportunities to integrate with the host culture and foster personal reflection in the context of rigorous study. Programs may allow students to pursue independent research, attend classes with local students, participate in community-based learning, or gain professional experience through academic internships, which, in turn, can serve as a basis for senior capstone projects. For more information on Santa Clara's Study Abroad and Global Programs, see Chapter 6 of this Bulletin.
