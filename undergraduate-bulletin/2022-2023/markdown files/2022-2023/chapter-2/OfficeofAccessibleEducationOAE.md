Office of Accessible Education
==============================

The Office of Accessible Education formerly "Disabilities Resources" has been designated by the University to ensure access for all undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities to all academic programs and campus resources. The goal is to support students with medical, physical, psychological, attention deficit, and learning disabilities, to participate fully in campus life, its programs, and activities. Emphasis is on growth and individual achievement through the provision of academic accommodations, support services, self-advocacy skill training, and disability-related educational programming for the campus community. Reasonable accommodations are provided to minimize the effects of a student's disability and to maximize the potential for success. A student may voluntarily register with the Office of Accessible Education by completing the [online registration form](https://www.scu.edu/oae/register-with-oae) and providing documentation of their disability, after which proper accommodations will be determined and implemented by the University.
