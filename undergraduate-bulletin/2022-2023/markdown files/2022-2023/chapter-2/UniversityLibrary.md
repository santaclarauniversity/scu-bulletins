**University Library**
----------------------

The Santa Clara University Library is a central hub for students to study and collaborate. The library has a mix of both individual and group seating, group study rooms, computer labs, outside patios, as well as a cafe on the first floor. Throughout the year the library hosts events, art exhibits, and late-night hours. Library staff are available to support student research---you can contact library staff in person at the Library Help Desk, by making an appointment online, or through our 24/7 chat service, "Ask a Librarian."

Library resources, which can be accessed within the library and remotely, include an online catalog (OSCAR), over 250 general and subject-specific databases, research guides for many subjects and some specific classes, and LINK+ and an interlibrary loan program. The library's collection includes books, ebooks, magazines and journals, streaming videos, and more.
