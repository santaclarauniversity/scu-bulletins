Entrepreneurship
================

*Director:* Keyvan Kashkooli

The entrepreneurship minor provides students who may be interested in either developing a business or working in a startup company the chance to explore that career option and acquire the skills that can help them to be successful. Students completing the minor should develop an understanding of the venture creation process including how to generate and develop a new business concept, apply analytical tools to identify and evaluate entrepreneurial opportunities, create and evaluate a business plan, and analyze different funding sources for a new venture. A critical element of the program is an internship working with an emerging for-profit or social benefit organization.

The entrepreneurship minor is open to all students via an application process through the Management and Entrepreneurship Department. F-1 international students are advised to consult with International Students and Scholars in the Global Engagement Office prior to applying to ensure they are able to meet the government immigration requirements for academic internships due to the internship requirement. Accepted business school students can begin the minor after they have earned 60 units. For students outside the business school, prerequisites for the core courses should ideally be completed in the sophomore year.
