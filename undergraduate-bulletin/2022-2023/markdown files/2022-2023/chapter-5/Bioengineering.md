Bioengineering is the fastest-growing segment of engineering today and holds the promise of improving the lives of all people in very direct and diverse ways. Bioengineering focuses on the application of biological, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and other engineering principles to understand, modify, or control biological systems, and educates students to solve problems at the interface of engineering and the life sciences.

The major in bioengineering is designed to prepare students for careers in the medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, graduate study in bioengineering, or entry into medical school.

The bioengineering minor is primarily designed for those students who are interested in the field but are majoring in other disciplines, particularly science majors, students completing prerequisites for medical school as part of their undergraduate degree, or engineering majors.

Combined Bachelor of Science and Master of Science Program
----------------------------------------------------------

The Department of Bioengineering offers a combined degree program leading to a bachelor of science and a master of science. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master\'s degree before completing the requirements for a bachelor\'s degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science in bioengineering within a year of completing the bachelor\'s degree.

Undergraduate students admitted to the combined degree program are required to enroll in the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor\'s degree after satisfying the standard undergraduate degree requirements. To earn a master\'s degree, students must fulfill all requirements for the degree, including the completion of 46 units of coursework beyond that applied to the bachelor\'s degree. The program of studies for the master\'s degree may include up to 20 units taken while enrolled as an undergraduate student; however, no individual course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor\'s degree and master\'s degree.

Bioengineering Laboratories
---------------------------

The Anatomy & Physiology Laboratory provides a full range of activities to study human anatomy and organ function. Through computational modeling, organ dissection, and design projects, students will develop essential skills in conceiving and implementing engineering solutions to medical problems.

The Bioimaging/Image and Signal Analysis Laboratory carries out basic and translational research on voice. Current research in the laboratory includes the development of imaging modalities to study laryngeal dynamics and function, and novel approaches for image/biosignal-based analysis and assessment of voice pathologies. The lab also supports the development of new detection and analytical methods using optical probes for applications in high-contrast fluorescence imaging in cells and tissues.

The Biological Micro/Nanosystems Laboratory supports research and teaching activities in the broad areas of microfluidics/biosensing. Utilizing microfluidic technologies, spectroscopy, and microfabrication techniques, we develop innovative microfluidic platforms for applications in basic biology, diagnostics, and cellular engineering.

The Biomaterials Engineering Laboratory focuses on the use of hydrogels to develop in vitro platforms that explore the role of in vivo-like microenvironmental cues on controlling protein structure and function and regulating cell fate. The lab also supports the design and characterization of biomaterial nanocomposites for applications in tissue engineering.

The Biomolecular Engineering Laboratory conducts "bioengineering towards therapy." The idea is to engineer novel materials (particularly proteins and peptides) and devices and apply them to study basic biological and medical questions that ultimately lead to drug discovery and disease diagnosis.

The Biophotonics & Bioimaging Laboratory supports research and teaching on portable imaging systems for wearable/implantable biosensors as well as on optical coherence tomography (OCT) probes for stereotactic neurosurgery. The time lapse fluorescence microscopy setup is used for measuring enzyme activity and single cell protein expression at the single molecular level.

The Biosignals Laboratory provides a full range of measurement and analysis capabilities including electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), and electromyography (EMG) measurement system, vocal signal recording, and analysis software.

The Micro-devices & Microfluidics Laboratory focuses on the fabrication and testing of microfluidic devices for biomedical research and teaching. The soft-lithography room is equipped with necessary instruments (e.g., mixer, spinner, plasma cleaner) to build micro-devices using a wide variety of materials and processes. Multiple microfluidic test setups (i.e., computer controlled solenoid valves and microscopes) allow several tests to be run simultaneously.

The Tissue Engineering Laboratory supports research and teaching activities related to mammalian cell and tissue culture. Activities include but are not limited to 2D and 3D mammalian cell culture, investigation of the role of biophysical cues on cancer cell migration and response to drugs, and genetic manipulation of mammalian cells.
