The Department of Computer Science and Engineering offers major programs leading to the bachelor of science in computer science and engineering, or the bachelor of science in web design and engineering. The computer science and engineering program features a balanced core in which each student studies the engineering aspects of software and hardware as well as the mathematical foundations of computation. Computer science and engineering electives permit students to build on this core with varying emphasis, depending on their interests. The web design and engineering program combines a technical education in computing with courses in graphic art, communication, and sociology to enable its graduates to understand the engineering infrastructure of the Web, how the Web affects society, and how the ways in which society uses the Web create new demands on technology. Instruction and research in the department's programs are supported by the facilities of the Engineering Computer Center and the University's Information Technology Center.

Combined Bachelor of Science and Master of Science Program
----------------------------------------------------------

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering offers a combined degree program leading to the bachelor of science and a master of science open to students pursuing an undergraduate degree at Santa Clara in computer science and engineering, web design and engineering, computer science, or electrical and computer engineering. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bachelor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science within a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree.

Undergraduate students admitted to the program may begin taking graduate courses no earlier than the fall term of their senior year, provided that both their overall GPA and their major GPA are at least 3.0. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the standard undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master's degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 46 or more units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree.

No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. Completion of 12 or more units of courses in computer science and engineering taken for the master's degree satisfies the Educational Enrichment requirement of the undergraduate program. Some courses required in the master's degree programs may be replaced by free electives due to similar undergraduate coursework.
