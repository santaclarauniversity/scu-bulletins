Catholic Studies
================

*Director:* Robert W. Scholla, S.J.

The minor in Catholic studies, open to students from all departments, is an interdisciplinary program for the study of the intellectual tradition of the Catholic faith. The minor is designed for intensive study of Catholicism as a faith embedded in many cultures and for the critical retrieval of the Catholic intellectual tradition through dialogue with contemporary thought under the rubrics of a variety of academic disciplines. Catholic studies minors are assigned a faculty mentor who guides them through the program. In conjunction with the Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education, the Catholic Studies program sponsors intellectual, cultural, social, and religious opportunities for both students and faculty.

At any point during their undergraduate studies, students may participate in an interdisciplinary introductory colloquium.
