The Department of Public Health in the College of Arts and Sciences offers the bachelor of science degree in public health science. The program also offers a minor degree in public health, and manages the Global Health Pathway of the University Core.

The public health science (PHS) major is an interdisciplinary degree focused on the health of human populations and individuals. Students will gain a solid foundation in biology and chemistry to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease. The major further explores the influences of environmental and social factors on human health through required and elective public health courses, as well as relevant courses in the social sciences and humanities. Through the senior capstone and mandatory internship, PHS majors engage in health-focused service and research projects that apply their education to real-world public health problems, and integrate learning across disciplines. Students are encouraged to study abroad to gain perspective on global health issues.

Public health science majors will be well-prepared for careers, graduate education, or professional training in public health or health-related professions, including medicine and nursing. There are many career options in the field of public health, including health care administration, planning, and public policy; epidemiology and disease surveillance; clinical research and clinical trials management; health-related education and social work; health and science communication; and basic research.

Students intending to pursue a medical degree, or postgraduate training in other health-related professions, should contact the University pre-health advisor to discuss prerequisites for admission to such programs. Many require a full year of physics coursework (e.g., PHYS 11-13 or 31-33) in addition to the requirements for the public health science major.

Requirements for the Minor
--------------------------

The interdisciplinary public health minor provides an introduction to the field of public health and is particularly useful for students interested in careers related to medicine, health care, community health, social work, education, or public policy. The minor establishes a sound scientific foundation to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease and to appreciate the mechanisms by which diseases arise and spread in populations. Students also develop a foundation in the social sciences and statistical methods. Upper-division courses address the influences of biological, environmental, cultural, economic, and historical factors on human health. Students are encouraged to study abroad, if possible, to gain perspective on global health issues. The Public Health Program is evolving and students are encouraged to petition the director of the Public Health Program to consider new relevant courses developed at Santa Clara University and partner institutions abroad in addition to the approved electives.
