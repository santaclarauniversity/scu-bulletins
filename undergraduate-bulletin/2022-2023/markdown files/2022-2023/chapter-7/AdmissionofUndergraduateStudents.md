Admission of Undergraduate Students
===================================

Santa Clara University is a selective admission university that admits new students based on past performance, potential for future academic success, and contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Applicants are admitted as full-time, degree-seeking students. Santa Clara does not have a part-time undergraduate program option and does not enroll non-degree students except international non-degree students participating in an approved international partnership. Non-degree international student programs are administered by Global Engagement. See the limited conditions outlined in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations.

Entering first-year and transfer students are admitted for fall and winter terms. Students are admitted for spring term only by special exception with the approval of the dean of admission.

Entering first-year students are admitted to the University and to a specific school and in some cases major based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schools may apply for a transfer only at the end of their first year of attendance.

Admission of Entering First-Year Students
-----------------------------------------

Admission of applicants to Santa Clara University as entering first-year students is based on their academic record in high school including course rigor, results on standardized tests when submitted, and other criteria outlined below. While Santa Clara University does not have a specific high school grade point average or standardized test score requirement, potential for successful academic performance in the rigorous undergraduate program at Santa Clara is correlated with high academic performance in high school. Santa Clara also bases admission on demonstrated potential for contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University, but only after assessment of academic performance and potential.

Applications for admission as an entering first-year student are evaluated using the following criteria:

-   Overall quality of high school courses and appropriately challenging coursework

-   Academic performance in high school, including the cumulative grade point average from the first year of high school through the junior year of high school (grades from the first term of the senior year may also be included)

-   Results of standardized SAT or ACT tests (optional)

-   One teacher evaluation from an 11th or 12th grade core academic class

-   Involvement in school and community activities

The basic subject recommendations for admission as an entering first-year student include:

-   History and Social Science: 3 years

-   English: 4 years

-   Mathematics: 3 years required; 4 years recommended

-   Laboratory Science: 2 years required; 3 years recommended

-   Language other than English: 2 years required; 3 years recommended; 4 years preferred

-   Visual and Performing Arts: 1 year recommended

-   College Preparatory Electives: 1 year

Admission of first-year student standing at Santa Clara depends on a continued high level of performance during the remainder of the applicant's senior year in the curriculum provided on the application and upon receipt of a high school diploma. If a significant change occurs in the applicant's academic performance during the senior year, his or her admission status may be reevaluated by the University.
