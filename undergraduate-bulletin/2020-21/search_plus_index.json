Students are responsible for knowing all academic and administrative policies and regulations affecting their program of study and for abiding by all such policies and regulations during their period of enrollment at the University. Continued enrollment is subject to compliance with the academic and administrative policies and regulations as described herein and otherwise published by the University. Failure to understand the policies and regulations does not relieve a student of his or her responsibility for adhering to the policies and regulations. Students are governed by the applicable degree requirements of the University and the Santa Clara Core Curriculum in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect in their entry year as first-year students. Transfer students normally follow the Undergraduate Bulletin of their class cohort as determined by the number of transfer units accepted toward the Santa Clara degree upon admission. All students must fulfill the departmental or program major and minor degree requirements in effect when they declare their major or minor program of study. Santa Clara University reserves the right to make changes to degree program requirements, academic and administrative policies and regulations, and course offerings published in the Undergraduate Bulletin at any time without prior notice. The University strives to assure the accuracy of the information in the Undergraduate Bulletin at the time of publication. However, the University reserves the right to make corrections as necessary to the Bulletin. The 2020-21 Undergraduate Bulletin was published in June 2020 by the Office of the Provost and covers policies and regulations in effect as of that date.

"},"chapter-1/SantaClaraUniversity.html":{"url":"chapter-1/SantaClaraUniversity.html","title":"Chapter 1: Santa Clara University","keywords":"","body":"Santa Clara University Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Santa Clara University is a comprehensive Jesuit, Catholic university with more than 8,800 students. Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, law, engineering, education, counseling psychology, pastoral ministries, and theology. The University boasts a diverse community of scholars offering a values-oriented curriculum characterized by small class sizes and a dedication to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education---educating the whole person for a life of service---run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs. Santa Clara University is perennially ranked among the top comprehensive universities by U.S. News & World Report and has one of the highest graduation rates for undergraduate students among all comprehensive universities. The University has a national reputation for its undergraduate program that features a distinctive core curriculum, an integrated learning environment, and research opportunities for undergraduate students. The University was established as Santa Clara College on the site of Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally operated as a preparatory school and did not offer collegiate courses until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. One-third of the students were enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college's preparatory and high school departments. Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added. In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business opened in 1926, and within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the country to receive national accreditation. For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admission explosion---from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began the largest building program in school history, erecting eight residence halls, a student union, and an athletic stadium. In 1985, the University adopted \"Santa Clara University\" as its official name. "},"chapter-1/UniversityMission.html":{"url":"chapter-1/UniversityMission.html","title":"University Vision, Mission, and Fundamental Values","keywords":"","body":"University Vision, Mission, and Fundamental Values Santa Clara University has adopted three directional statements to describe the kind of university it aspires to become (Strategic Vision), its core purpose and the constituencies it serves (University Mission), and the beliefs that guide its actions (Fundamental Values). Strategic Vision Santa Clara University will educate citizens and leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion, and cultivate knowledge and faith to build a more humane, just, and sustainable world. University Mission The University pursues its vision by creating an academic community that educates the whole person within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition, making student learning our central focus, continuously improving our curriculum and co-curriculum, strengthening our scholarship and creative work, and serving the communities of which we are a part in Silicon Valley and around the world. Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educational environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institutional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society. We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to the development of: Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily residential setting Graduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contributions to their fields In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for nonmatriculated students. Fundamental Values The University is committed to these core values, which guide us in carrying out our mission and realizing our vision: Academic Excellence. We seek an uncompromising standard of excellence in teaching, learning, creativity, and scholarship within and across disciplines. Search for Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. We prize scholarship and creative work that advance human understanding, improve teaching and learning, and add to the betterment of society by illuminating the most significant problems of the day and exploring the enduring mysteries of life. In this search, our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering. Engaged Learning. We strive to integrate academic reflection and direct experience in the classroom and the community, especially to understand and improve the lives of those with the least education, power, and wealth. Commitment to Students. As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, we endeavor to educate the whole person. We nurture and challenge students---intellectually, spiritually, aesthetically, morally, socially, and physically---preparing them for leadership and service to the common good in their professional, civic, and personal lives. Service to Others. We promote throughout the University a culture of service---service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its most disadvantaged members as we work with and for others to build a more humane, just, faith-filled, and sustainable world. Community and Diversity. We cherish our diverse and inclusive community of students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni, a community that is enriched by people of different backgrounds, respectful of the dignity of all its members, enlivened by open communication, and caring and just toward others. Jesuit Distinctiveness. We treasure our Jesuit heritage and tradition, which incorporates all of these core values. This tradition gives expression to our Jesuit educational mission and Catholic identity while also welcoming and respecting other religious and philosophical traditions, promoting the dialogue between faith and culture, and valuing opportunities to deepen religious beliefs.

The Jesuit School of Theology (JST) is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the United States operated by the Society of Jesus, as the order of Catholic priests is known. It is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the country that offer three ecclesiastical degrees certified by the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education, and it also offers four advanced theological degrees certified by the Association of Theological Schools. In addition, JST offers a spiritual renewal program for clergy, religious, and lay people, and conducts an annual Instituto Hispano that offers a certificate program to advance Hispanic leadership in the pastoral life of the church. "},"chapter-1/CentersofDistinction.html":{"url":"chapter-1/CentersofDistinction.html","title":"Centers of Distinction","keywords":"","body":"Centers of Distinction Santa Clara University has three Centers of Distinction that serve as major points of interaction between the University and local and global communities. Each center focuses on a theme that is central to Santa Clara's distinctive mission as a Jesuit university and offers an educational environment integrating rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. Each center engages faculty and students from different disciplines as well as experts and leaders from the community through speakers, conferences, workshops, and experiential learning opportunities. Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship The mission of the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship is to accelerate global, innovation-based entrepreneurship in service to humanity. Through an array of programs, including its signature Global Social Benefit Institute (GSBI‚Ñ¢), the Center engages an international network of social enterprises, investment capital, and technical resources to build the capacity of the global social entrepreneurship movement. As a Center of Distinction at Santa Clara University, the Center leverages its programs to inspire faculty and students with real-world case studies, distinctive curricula, and unique research opportunities, advancing the University's vision of creating a more just, humane, and sustainable world. More information can be found at the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship website. Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education The Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education promotes and enhances the distinctively Jesuit, Catholic tradition of education at Santa Clara University, with a view toward serving students, faculty, staff, and through them the larger community, both local and global. The Ignatian Center achieves this mission chiefly through four signature programs: Bannan Institutes provide yearlong thematic programs, including academic events and scholarly activities that further the Jesuit, Catholic character of the University. Community-based learning places over 1,200 students each year with community partners, frequently in connection with an academic course. Immersion programs offer students, during academic breaks, the opportunity to experience local, domestic, and international communities with little access to wealth, power, and privilege. Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius provide opportunities for members of the community to encounter the spiritual sources of the Jesuit tradition. Through these four programs, the Ignatian Center aspires to be recognized throughout Silicon Valley and beyond as providing leadership for the integration of faith, justice, and the intellectual life. Markkula Center for Applied Ethics The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics brings the traditions of ethical thinking to bear on real-world problems. Our mission is to engage individuals and organizations in making choices that ‚Äãrespect and care for others. Beyond a full range of events, grants, and fellowships for the Santa Clara University community, the Center serves professionals in business, education, health care, government, journalism, and the social sector---providing training, programs, and roundtables that explore the ethical challenges in the field. In addition, we focus on ethical issues in leadership, technology, and the internet. Through our website and international collaborations, we also bring ethical decision-making resources to the wider world.

"},"chapter-1/Alumni.html":{"url":"chapter-1/Alumni.html","title":"Alumni","keywords":"","body":"Alumni Santa Clara University has over 96,120 alumni living in all 50 states and more than 100 countries. More than half of the alumni live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many are leaders in business, law, engineering, academia, and public service. "},"chapter-1/Campus.html":{"url":"chapter-1/Campus.html","title":"Campus","keywords":"","body":"Campus The University is located on a 106-acre campus in the city of Santa Clara near the southern end of the San Francisco Bay in one of the world's greatest cultural centers. More than 50 buildings on campus house 15 student residences, a main library, a law library, two student centers, the de Saisset Museum, extensive performing arts and athletic facilities, and a recreation and fitness center. Santa Clara's campus has the advantage of being located in Silicon Valley, a region known for its extraordinary visionaries, who have designed and created some of the most significant scientific and technological advances of our age. Silicon Valley is more than a location---it is a mindset, and home to more than 3 million residents and 6,600 science- and technology-related companies (not including San Francisco, which is located just an hour away). Santa Clara's campus is well known for its beauty and mission-style architecture. Opened in 2013, the brick-paved Abby Sobrato Mall leads visitors from the University's main entrance to the heart of campus---the Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s. The roses and palm and olive trees of the Mission Gardens surround the historic Mission Church, which was restored in 1928. The adjacent Adobe Lodge is the oldest building on campus. In 1981, it was restored to its 1822 decor. Academic Facilities Amidst all this beauty and history are modern, world-class academic facilities. Students study and thrive in places such as the Joanne E. Harrington Learning Commons, Sobrato Family Technology Center, and Orradre Library, where individuals and groups can study in an inviting, light-filled, and open environment. Notably, the library features an Automated Retrieval System, a high-density storage area where up to 900,000 books and other publications can be stored and retrieved using robotic-assisted technology. Another example of Santa Clara's excellent academic facilities is Lucas Hall, home of the Leavey School of Business. This modern 85,000-square-foot building houses classrooms, meeting rooms, offices, study spaces, and a caf√©. Classrooms are equipped with state-of-the-art videoconferencing equipment as well as a multiplatform system to record faculty lectures for later review by students. Vari Hall (formerly Arts & Sciences), adjacent to Lucas Hall, is home to the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics as well as academic departments, classrooms, and a 2,200-square-foot digital television studio, regarded as among the best studios found on any campus nationwide. Located near Vari Hall is the Schott Admission and Enrollment Services Building, a welcome center for campus visitors and home to several University departments. Opened in 2012, the lobby of this green-certified structure includes technology-infused exhibits that illustrate Santa Clara's Jesuit mission. Among other green features on campus are two solar-powered homes built in 2007 and 2009 for the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon. Both homes now serve as laboratories for solar and sustainability technologies. Student Life Santa Clara has 10 on-campus residence halls, most with traditional double rooms and large common bathrooms; others with suite arrangements conducive to more informal living. Juniors and seniors can apply for townhouse-style living in the 138-unit University Villas across from the main campus. Opened in 2012, Graham Hall is an environmentally friendly building with 96 mini-suites, lounges, full kitchens, and laundry facilities for every eight-room \"neighborhood.\" In addition, the residence hall has two classrooms, a small theater, outdoor barbecue and picnic areas, and a large courtyard. The Robert F. Benson Memorial Center serves as a hub for campus life. The Benson Center offers dining services and houses the campus bookstore, the campus post office, and meeting rooms. The University's main dining hall, The Marketplace, resembles an upscale food court with numerous stations and options. For a more informal experience, The Bronco is the Benson Center's late-night venue, serving beverages and pub-style food. Another hot-spot for student life, the Paul L. Locatelli, S.J., Student Activity Center, includes a 6,000 square-foot gathering hall with a high ceiling that can accommodate dances and concerts as well as pre- and post-game activities. Designed with environmental sensitivity, the building is energy efficient and has daytime lighting controls and motion sensors to maximize use of natural light. For fitness-minded students, the Pat Malley Fitness and Recreation Center features a 9,500-square-foot weight training and cardiovascular exercise room, three basketball courts, a swimming pool, and other facilities to support the recreational and fitness needs of the campus community. The campus includes many locations for quiet reflection, such as the St. Clare Garden, which features plants and flowers arranged into five groups to portray the stages of the saint's life. For campus members who want a more hands-on relationship with nature, the Forge Garden, SCU's half-acre organic garden, serves as a campus space for course research, service learning, and sustainable food production. Athletics and the Arts The importance of athletics to the University is evident everywhere on campus. Among the newest additions to Santa Clara's athletics facilities are the Stephen Schott Stadium, home field for the men's baseball team, and the state-of-the-art Stevens Soccer Training Center, funded by a gift from Mary and Mark Stevens. The gift also allowed Santa Clara to upgrade the stands in Stevens Stadium (formerly Buck Shaw Stadium), home to the men's and women's soccer programs, and build a plaza to celebrate Bronco sports---its past, present, and future. The plaza celebrates the history of Santa Clara University football as well as the legacy and future of men's and women's soccer at SCU. Bellomy Field, eight acres of well-lit and grassy playing fields, provides space for club and intramural sports, such as rugby and field hockey. Adjacent to Bellomy Field is the well-appointed women's softball field, which opened in 2013. The Leavey Event Center houses the University's premier basketball facility. Over the years, the Leavey Event Center has hosted nine West Coast Conference Basketball Championships. The University recognizes the arts as an important part of life at Santa Clara University. The Edward M. Dowd Art and Art History Building opened in 2016, housing an integrated fine arts program that is a destination and a center for inspiration, innovation, and engagement in the arts and art history in Silicon Valley. The de Saisset Museum, the University's accredited museum of art and history, presents changing art exhibitions throughout the year and serves as the caretaker of the University's California History Collection, which includes artifacts from the Native American, Mission, and early Santa Clara College periods. SCU‚Ä¢Presents represents the University's commitment to the performing arts on campus, which includes performances at venues such as the Louis B. Mayer Theatre, the Fess Parker Studio Theatre, and the Music Recital Hall. The Mayer Theatre is Santa Clara University's premier theatrical venue, housing 500 intimate seats in either a flexible proscenium or thrust-stage setting. The Fess Parker Studio Theatre has no fixed stage or seating. Its black box design, complete with movable catwalks, provides flexibility in an experimental setting. The 250-seat Music Recital Hall provides a contemporary setting where students, faculty, and guest artists offer a variety of performances. "},"chapter-2/TransformativeExperiencesandLearningResources.html":{"url":"chapter-2/TransformativeExperiencesandLearningResources.html","title":"Chapter 2: Transformative Experiences and Learning Resources","keywords":"","body":"Transformative Experiences and Learning Resources Santa Clara University is committed to the education of the whole person in the Jesuit and Catholic tradition, with a vision of developing people to be leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion. The undergraduate program is designed for students who seek an education that integrates Jesuit values and learning that prepares them for 21st-century challenges in a primarily residential setting. Varied educational experiences encourage students to value differing ways of knowing and being in the world, different forms of knowledge within established disciplines, and new knowledge as well as that which preceded it. Santa Clara's concept of the \"whole person\" inevitably embraces our social nature. When he inaugurated Santa Clara's sesquicentennial year in 2000, Fr. Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then superior general of the Society of Jesus, noted that \"Tomorrow's 'whole person' cannot be whole without an educated awareness of society and culture with which to contribute socially, generously, in the real world.\" Affirming that the Jesuit educational standard must always \"educate the whole person of solidarity for the real world,\" he explained: \"Students, in the course of their formation, must let the gritty reality of this world into their lives, so they can learn to feel it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering, and engage in it constructively. They should learn to perceive, think, judge, choose, and act for the rights of others, especially the disadvantaged and the oppressed.\" Since then, Santa Clara University has revised the Core Curriculum, implemented a new Integrated Strategic Plan, extended the impact of its Centers of Excellence, and enhanced the University's cocurricular programs, all with the goal of educating students who will apply what they are learning to constructive engagement with the gritty realities of the 21st century. The Santa Clara undergraduate program offers courses and other learning experiences whose content and patterns combine the acquisition and creation of knowledge with the quest for meaning and purpose. Santa Clara's learning environments encourage students to make connections across the Core Curriculum, the academic major, elective courses, and cocurricular experiences. Students are encouraged to relate their classroom learning with out-of-classroom learning through community-based education, Residential Learning Communities, Campus Ministry, a wide variety of student organizations, athletics and recreation, and other experiences. In a more general way, the undergraduate program nurtures students' ability to knit the intellectual, social, moral, spiritual, creative, and behavioral aspects of life into a coherent and meaningful whole. "},"chapter-2/TheCoreCurriculum.html":{"url":"chapter-2/TheCoreCurriculum.html","title":"The Core Curriculum","keywords":"","body":"The Core Curriculum A university expresses its most basic values in its Core Curriculum that is part of an undergraduate education required of all students. Santa Clara's Core Curriculum explicitly integrates three traditions of higher education. As a Catholic university, it is rooted in the tradition of pursuing an understanding of God through the free exercise of reason. As a Jesuit university, it promotes a humanistic education that leads toward ethical engagement with the world. As a comprehensive American university committed to liberal education, Santa Clara seeks to prepare its students for intelligent, responsible, and creative citizenship. Reflecting these traditions, the Core Curriculum provides every undergraduate with the common learning that all students need to become leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion. The distinctiveness of a Santa Clara education emerges in the Core Curriculum, both in its sense of purpose rooted in the University's traditions and in its commitment to a breadth of learning for the 21st century that complements and supports all majors. The Core Curriculum opens students to the study and practice of the arts, humanities, mathematics, technology, natural sciences, and social sciences. It educates students for interdisciplinary understanding and ethically informed participation in civic life. Opportunities for experiential learning foster the development of compassion and attention to the ways human suffering can be alleviated. Reflecting the University's founding mission, the Core Curriculum includes a disciplined and critical reflection on the religious dimensions of human existence. In addition, because the Core Curriculum continually highlights the critical and compelling questions facing individuals and communities, the Core Curriculum supports students both in making professional career choices and in discerning their larger vocation‚Äîtheir life's purpose in the world. Learning Goals: What will students learn in the Core Curriculum? Because a liberal education in the Jesuit tradition is oriented toward particular ends, the Core Curriculum affirms a set of central learning goals. These goals are divided among three broad categories: Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World. Knowledge To be prepared for well-informed engagement in society, students must comprehend the forces that have shaped the world they have inherited and the ways the world is interpreted and understood. They must also understand how they might transform the world for the better. The Core Curriculum deepens students' knowledge of the ideas and ways of knowing that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences. Global Cultures: The intertwined development of global ideas, institutions, religions, and cultures, including Western cultures Arts and Humanities: The production, interpretation, and social influence of the fine and performing arts, history, languages, literatures, philosophy, and religion Scientific Inquiry: The principles of scientific inquiry and how they are applied in the natural and social sciences Science and Technology: The formative influences, dynamics, social impacts, and ethical consequences of scientific and technological development Diversity: Diverse human experiences, identities, and cultures within local and global societies, especially as formed by relations of power and privilege Civic Life: The roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens and institutions in societies and in the world Habits of Mind and Heart To contribute to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world, students must develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that allow them to educate themselves for the rest of their lives with passion and purpose. By attending to the cognitive and affective dimensions of human experience, the Core Curriculum enables students to think more deeply, imagine more freely, and communicate more clearly. Critical Thinking: The ability to identify, reflect upon, evaluate, integrate, and apply different types of information and knowledge to form independent judgments Mathematics and Quantitative Reasoning: Analytical and logical thinking and the habit of drawing conclusions based on quantitative information Complexity: An approach to understanding the world that appreciates ambiguity and nuance as well as clarity and precision Ethical Reasoning: Drawing on ethical traditions to assess the consequences of individual and institutional decisions Religious Reflection: Questioning and clarifying beliefs through critical inquiry into faith and the religious dimensions of human existence Communication: Interacting effectively with different audiences, especially through writing, speech, and a second language Engagement with the World To engage with the world in meaningful ways, students need opportunities to explore and refine self-knowledge in relation to others. The Core Curriculum enhances students' understanding of the integrity of their own lives and the dignity inherent in the lives of others, especially the impoverished, suffering, and marginalized. Perspective: Seeking out the experience of different cultures and people, striving to view the world through their eyes Collaboration: The capacity to collaborate intellectually and creatively with diverse people Social Justice: Developing a disciplined sensibility toward the causes of human suffering and misery, and a sense of responsibility for addressing them Civic Engagement: Addressing major contemporary social issues, including environmental sustainability and peaceful resolution of conflict, by participating actively as an informed citizen of society and the world Each course in the Core Curriculum addresses at least three of the learning goals listed above. Students have multiple opportunities to encounter, practice, and master each learning goal. In addition, specific learning objectives for each area of the Core Curriculum have been developed by faculty Core Curriculum committees. These learning objectives are associated with particular learning goals and describe the knowledge, skills, and values students will be able to demonstrate after completing the courses in the Core Curriculum. The learning objectives are posted on the Core Curriculum website. Structure of the Core Curriculum The structure of the Core features three phases designed to foster developmental learning and curricular coherence. The first phase, Foundations, consists of courses normally taken in the first year, introducing students to the processes and expectations for university-level education: Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 Second Language (level required varies by major) Mathematics Religion, Theology & Culture 1 This phase helps students begin to set their own goals for learning, preparing them to make thoughtful choices in the Core Curriculum, their majors, and cocurricular activities. The second phase, Explorations, offers students the opportunity to choose among courses that will expand and deepen their understanding of a broad range of subject areas needed for effective participation in contemporary life as well as satisfy requirements in students' majors. Explorations requirements: Ethics Civic Engagement Diversity: U.S. Perspectives Arts Social Science Natural Science Science, Technology & Society Cultures & Ideas 3 Religion, Theology & Culture 2 Religion, Theology & Culture 3 Students in Arts and Sciences and Business satisfy their Core Foundations and Explorations requirements with one course per Core area. Engineering students may satisfy more than one Core requirement with a single course when the course has been approved for both Core areas. Students who double major across schools/colleges must complete the Core requirements for each of their programs. The third phase, Integrations, consists of these requirements: Experiential Learning for Social Justice Advanced Writing Pathways These Core components are often embedded in courses students take to fulfill other requirements. These courses offer students the opportunity to examine the connections between courses in different disciplines, between the classroom and the wider community, and between their coursework and the professions. Student progress through the Core Curriculum is not strictly sequential, from Foundations through Explorations to Integrations. While some courses (e.g., Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2; Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2; and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3) must be taken in sequence, all students have the opportunity to discover other sequences that are best for their individual undergraduate experience while engaging in coursework designed to address the shared set of learning objectives for each component of the Core Curriculum. Furthermore, the Integrations components of the Core Curriculum help students experience requirements not only as individual courses but as related educational activities that help structure and integrate their entire experience of University study. The Core Curriculum website provides more detailed information about each component of the Core Curriculum, the learning goals and objectives associated with each component, the core policies, and the courses from which students may choose. Students are encouraged to check their degree audit in eCampus regularly to determine their progress in the Core Curriculum and other academic requirements. The Core Curriculum and the College of Arts and Sciences Students in the College of Arts and Sciences should consult Chapter 3 for the requirements for their majors. The Undergraduate Core Curriculum is designed to provide both a foundation and supplement to major requirements. The Core Curriculum and the Leavey School of Business Leavey School of Business requirements determine how students in the business school satisfy some Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements‚Äîsome Core Curriculum requirements are fulfilled with courses that also apply to the Business Core Curriculum..

Transfer Credit and the Core Curriculum All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; Religion, Theology & Culture courses; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for Social Justice; and Pathways. For all other Core requirements, it is possible for students to earn credit by taking Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, or by completing college-level courses prior to enrolling at Santa Clara. Transfer credit earned from courses completed before enrollment at Santa Clara is governed by two sets of rules: one for students admitted as first-year students and another for transfer students. Students admitted as first-year students must satisfy Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2, and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3 with courses completed at Santa Clara University. In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2, before their first quarter at Santa Clara. Information about possible substitutions for Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas courses is available in the Office of the Registrar. Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units and incomplete CTW or C&I sequences must take both courses in the Critical Thinking & Writing 1 & 2 sequence and/or in the Cultures & Ideas 1 & 2 sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, and have completed the first course in the sequence, will complete the sequence with an advanced course (either Cultures & Ideas 3 or Advanced Writing, depending on the sequence). Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in sequential order. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, must complete two courses from the Religion, Theology & Culture sequence in any order. Transfer students must declare their Pathways by the end of their third quarter at SCU. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units must take four courses (minimum of 16 units) toward the Pathways requirement. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) toward the Pathways requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) toward the Pathways requirement. All seniors write an integrative essay to complete their Pathway requirement. More detailed Pathway guidelines are available on the Pathways website. Transfer credit earned from courses completed after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill Core Curriculum or other requirements. Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the chapter(s) relevant to their school or college.

By creating a culture in which students connect their academic experiences with their social and residential ones, the learning communities enhance the education of the whole person and deepen the connection between learning and living as responsible members of a community. All entering first-year students, whether or not they live on campus, become members of one of eight theme-based Residential Learning Communities. Nonresident first-year students are given access to the residence hall in which their learning community is located so that they can participate fully in its programs. In the theme-based learning communities, resident directors and faculty directors coordinate with spirituality facilitators and student staff to encourage high academic achievement, effective community living, and individual development. Students take at least one Core Foundations sequence in common with others in their learning community, enriching coursework and promoting the formation of study groups. Students also interact directly with faculty and staff and participate in theme-based cocurricular and extracurricular activities both on and off campus. Residential Learning Communities are primarily two-year communities, but some offer the opportunity for students to remain throughout their undergraduate careers. University residence halls accommodate more than half of the undergraduate population in coeducational communities with common lounge areas, study rooms, kitchen and laundry facilities, and other services. Most residence halls offer traditional double-occupancy rooms with common bath facilities; some halls offer suites and apartment-style accommodations with bathrooms en suite. All residence hall rooms and suites are equipped with cable television connections, Ethernet, and wireless network service.

Numerous programs of study are available, including American politics, public law, U.S. foreign policy, international environment and development, economic policy, journalism, international business and trade, peace and conflict resolution, and contemporary Islam. Several programs include a three-week international travel component, along with study in Washington, D.C. Students participating in the Washington Semester Program earn 22.5 to 24 quarter credits for one semester of study. Grades and units received at American University will count toward the student's SCU grade point average and course requirements for the department and the University when appropriate. The Panetta Institute Congressional Internship Program The Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University, Monterey Bay, founded by Santa Clara political science alumnus Leon Panetta, offers an opportunity for students to gain an inside look at the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government and Washington, D.C., politics. This congressional internship begins with a two-week course at California State University, Monterey Bay, where students work directly with seasoned veterans examining the legislative process and its functions. The remaining two-and-a-half months of the internship are spent in Washington, D.C., working on Capitol Hill in the office of a member of the California congressional delegation. One exceptional Santa Clara University student is chosen each year for this fully subsidized internship. Eligibility To be eligible to participate in one of these public sector studies programs, students must have completed at least 88 quarter units of credit by the date that the program of study begins, must not be on academic or disciplinary probation, and must be in good financial standing with the University.

A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by medical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the communication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school and in one's subsequent medical practice. Although Santa Clara does not have a premed major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in biochemistry, genetics, and human physiology, which are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The combination of Core Curriculum requirements with the University's focus on community involvement and issues of diversity will prepare students well for the MCAT 2015, with its greater emphasis on social, economic, and psychological determinants of health. Students should visit the Pre-Health Advising website and maintain regular contact with the pre-health sciences advisor throughout their undergraduate years for assistance with adjusting to college academic rigor and social life; developing an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; achieving balance between academics, social life, work, health community volunteering, and internships; selecting relevant entrance examinations; and applying to graduate health-science programs. Pre-Law Advising Advisors: Mike Dana, Melissa Donegan, Matthew Harrigan, Diana Morlang Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their undergraduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors. Consultation with a pre-law advisor familiarizes the student with the rigors of law school, the practice of law, the burden of law school debt, and the means to best secure employment as an attorney. Advisors will help formulate a program to prepare students for the complexity of the application process, including preparation for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Successful law school applicants come from a diversity of majors, such as anthropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biology, and economics. However, to successfully prepare for the LSAT, students are advised to select courses that deepen reading comprehension and promote logical reasoning. Law school admissions officers generally recommend undergraduate preparation by selecting a major that demands discipline, analytical ability, research skills, close reading of texts, creativity, verbal skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of philosophy and political science offer a pre-law emphasis within the major (in philosophy, it is also available within the minor). Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experience. Some elective courses strengthen specific abilities, while others provide perspective on legal issues and topics. Recommended electives are located on the website. Pre-Teaching Advising Advisor: Sarah MacGregor Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing to offer professional preparation for prospective elementary school, middle school, and senior high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades, both with a cross-cultural language and academic development emphasis. The teaching credential program at SCU is combined with a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Students interested in teaching should consider completing an interdisciplinary minor in urban education offered through the College of Arts and Sciences. The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area, who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to undergraduate studies and the credential/MAT program. The FTP is managed through the Child Studies Program. For more information, see Chapter 3, Child Studies Program.

The department also offers a minor, several emphases, and an honors thesis option. Requirements for the Major In addition to fulfilling the undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students majoring in anthropology must complete the following departmental requirements: ANTH 1 ANTH 2 ANTH 3 ANTH 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 ANTH/ENVS 50 ANTH 110 One of the following statistics courses: MATH 8, BIO 160/ENVS 110, PSYC 105, POLI 101 One of the following Methods 1 courses: ANTH 111, 112, 113 One of the following Methods 2 courses: ENVS 116/116a, PSYC 105, BIO 160/ENVS 110 (in addition to MATH 8), or an additional ANTH Methods I class ANTH 114 ANTH 198 Six upper-division courses selected from the following three categories (all three categories must be represented): Archaeology (ANTH 140--149, 173, 186, 189) Biological Anthropology (ANTH 130--139) Cultural Anthropology (ANTH 150--179, 184, 185, 187, 188) Attending six Anthropology Seminars is required for majors Emphasis Programs in Anthropology Anthropology majors have the option of completing a special emphasis program to complement their majors. The emphasis is not a narrow specialization but reflects competence in the subfields of the discipline. Completion of a special emphasis program will be noted on student transcripts with the approval of the department chair. The emphasis in applied anthropology prepares students to use anthropological knowledge to address critical human issues in careers outside academia. Through coursework and related internships, students will gain a better understanding of how anthropological knowledge and skills can be used in occupations related to health and medicine, international development, environment, government, business, education, immigration, and poverty. The emphasis in archaeology focuses on a deeper understanding of the human past and how it is studied. This is a possible course of study for majors with an interest in employment in cultural resource management or graduate study in archaeology. The biological emphasis provides in-depth training in the field of biological anthropology. Students will acquire intellectual breadth and depth with regard to the interdisciplinary nature of anthropology and the biological and cultural interactions that have influenced human evolution and modern human diversity. Requirements for the Minor Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in anthropology: ANTH 1 or 2 ANTH 3 One additional lower-division anthropology course ANTH 110 Two approved upper-division anthropology courses Four anthropology seminars Lower-Division Courses 1. Introduction to Biological Anthropology Using an evolutionary framework, we examine how past and current human variation is measured, our place in nature, human genetics, human and nonhuman primate biology and behavior, the primate and hominin fossil record, and the origin and meaning of human biological and behavioral variation. Students gain experience in biological anthropology methods, data analysis and interpretation, and the theoretical frameworks that guide our understanding of what it means to be human. Laboratory 15 hours. (4 units) 2. Introduction to Archaeology How do archaeologists understand the past? This course examines the methods, theories, and analytical techniques that archaeologists use to study the past and interpret ancient cultures. Selective survey of human cultures over time in different regions of the world. Laboratory 15 hours. (4 units) 3. Introduction Cultural Anthropology This course provides an introduction to the subject matter, research methods, and applications of cultural anthropology. Its purpose is to help students understand how different human groups think and live, how they cope with life's demands and expectations, and how they make sense of the world. In order to gain additional experience with diverse cultural groups, students are required to participate in off-campus Arrupe partnerships. (4 units) 4. Vanished Peoples and Lost Civilizations \"Popular archaeology\" is addressed by examining past societies, human migrations and cultural contacts, and ancient human behavior and technologies. Ideas and assumptions found in movies and other popular media will be evaluated in light of current archaeological data and theory. (4 units) 5. Popular Culture and Bioanthropology From King Kong to Clan of the Cave Bear, students examine popular culture interpretations of biological anthropology. After reviewing the history of biological anthropology, we analyze popular avenues (film, cartoons, newspapers, fiction) through which the public has been informed about human variation, the human fossil record, primate behavior, and human genetics. (4 units) 6. Screen Time: Culture, Film, and Media in the 21st Century This course uses anthropological perspectives and methods to explore how popular media shapes, creates, and transforms our understanding of culture, identity, and social relationships in the 21st century. This course is not just about culture, difference, and identity, but also about how we learn about and intersect with cultural and identity formation processes through various forms of media. Throughout the course we will use feature-length films as starting points for thinking critically about culture, gender, class, race/racism, economics, ideology, family, kinship, and violence. We will also be critically discussing how film and media shape our perceptions and understandings of the complex, global, and highly socially mediated world in which we live. One of the core premises of this course, following Bird and Godwin (2006), is that we cannot simply assume that media \"speaks for itself.\" Building upon the work of cultural and media anthropologists, and the late Neil Postman, the primary goal of this course is to push students to take a more active, and anthropologically informed, approach to the highly mediated world in which we live. (4 units) 7. Field Course in Archaeological Methods On-site archaeological field research with practical experience in the basic techniques of excavation and data analysis. Students will gain experience in mapping, stratigraphic excavation, and field processing of finds. Laboratory component will include community outreach, cataloging, and relevant special analyses.

Barton, Samuel R. Hernandez Professors: Kathy Aoki, Kelly Detweiler, Kathleen Maxwell, Kate Morris Associate Professors: Blake de Maria (Harold and Edythe Toso Professor), Don Fritz, Takeshi Moro, Andrea Pappas (Department Chair), Ryan Reynolds Assistant Professor: Heather Clydesdale, Qiuwen Li Senior Lecturers: Renee Billingslea, Pancho Jim√©nez Lecturers: Ryan Carrington, Jessica Eastburn The Department of Art and Art History offers degree programs leading to the bachelor of arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both disciplines fostering a thorough understanding of the history and practice of art. Department faculty encourage interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara community through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of college and undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements, as well as offering courses through the University Honors Program. Art History Art history majors at Santa Clara examine the broad range of human visual expression, across space and time, developing understandings of the meanings and purposes of the visual arts, including their historical development, roles in society, and relationships to other fields in the humanities. Students benefit from a program distinguished by excellent teaching and mentoring, challenging coursework, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, and student internships at local and Bay Area institutions. The art history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth that help students learn to think critically and communicate clearly about works of art. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in our annual Art History Symposium and the Art History Research Paper Competition. The art history major develops the following skills: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysis of visual objects and textual sources, advanced research and writing skills, and sophisticated oral presentations. The cultural understanding and intellectual skills developed through the program enable art history majors to pursue a wide variety of interests in a wide spectrum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history. Studio Art Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or careers in either the fine or commercial arts. Faculty members emphasize the development of conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student's own work and that of others. By graduation, every studio art major develops a body of original artwork to be exhibited in a senior show for display in the department gallery space. In conjunction with the senior show, students are required to articulate an artist's statement reflecting their own engagement with the creative process, in conjunction with their senior show. Studio art majors enjoy opportunities to present their artwork in regional conferences as well as in student-organized exhibitions on and off campus. At the end of each academic year, students are encouraged to submit their work to the Annual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professional in the field of art. The Department also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are awarded to outstanding studio art majors with junior standing.

Art in the Age of Exploration: Introduction to Early Modern Europe Few periods in the history of art inspire greater reverence than the Renaissance. But why? What enables objects such as Michelangelo's David or Leonardo's Mona Lisa to become pop culture icons in the 21st century? This survey course of European visual culture from approximately 1348 to 1648 seeks to answer this question through the study of canonical works; artists such as Raphael, Titian, and D√ºrer; and artistic centers including Venice, Florence, Rome, and Paris. Other topics for discussion may include the patronage and production of art; the visual construction of gender identity; the relationship between art, science, and religion brought about by humanist study; and the impact of global trade and exploration on the development of European visual culture.

Making China Modern On the long march from dynastic regime to global power, art has made China modern on its own terms. In the 19th century writers, politicians, and revolutionaries looked to Japan and Europe to learn how art could renovate the nation. After WWI, leftists weaponized woodcuts and folk arts to combat the forces of Japan and the U.S.-backed Nationalists. At the dawn of the People's Republic, art reorganized society and fueled radical conformity. As China globalized, artists cashed in on burgeoning markets, grappled with legacies, sounded alarms about oppression, and questioned \"The Chinese Dream.\" Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units) 30. The Built Environment The Built Environment examines the human factors responsible for shaping the spaces in which we live and work.

Fulfills the Studio Art Program modern or contemporary emphasis course requirement. (4 units) 66. Fabricating Nature in East Asia Across East Asia, artists and designers have fabricated landscapes to marshall natural forces for human-centered purposes. In China, visualizing Confucian and Daoist principles through paintings and gardens ordered society and cultivated individuals. In Korea, artists interpreted imported religions and philosophies through indigenous beliefs, giving birth to True View painting and seowon rural campuses. Japan's native ShintoÃÑ steered Buddhism in new directions, culminating in Zen and roji tea gardens. Today, these religions, philosophies, aesthetics, and practices remain vigorous, exerting themselves in art and landscape design worldwide, offering solutions to environmental challenges, and alternatives to the isolation of modern life. Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units) 81. Modern Indian Art This course will take you through a survey of modern Indian art in the 20th century. We will see how Indian artists constantly engaged with and responded to modernity and the modernisms they encountered in the global art world, while working through late-colonial, post-independence and contemporary Indian contexts. Early modern artists of the Bengal School of art grappled with the question of how to be \"modern\" and \"Indian\" in their search for an \"Indian-ness\" devoid of Western elements, while post-independence artists of the Progressive Artists Group could freely work with both Western modernism and Indian idioms toward self-expression. We will see how this trajectory moves into contemporary art and also contextualize feminism by reading about the works of women artists from varied backgrounds. Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement. (4 units) 97. Special Topics Occasional courses in selected art historical topics. May be repeated for credit. (4 units) 98. Internship/Practicum Individual projects in conjunction with professional visual arts agencies. May be repeated for credit but no more than 4 units may count toward the major or minor.

Keeping up with the Medici: Fame and Family in Renaissance Florence What makes someone a \"household name\"? Is it talent, beauty, connections, or simply shrewd marketing? While fame, fortune, and celebrity may seem like modern phenomena, the cult of personality was equally prominent in Renaissance Florence. As is the case today, money played a key role in the arts. This course focuses on the ways in which the Medici family, through their social, financial, and spiritual support, transformed the city of Florence from an Italian commune with limited natural resources into the center of the European culture. And in doing so, transformed the notion of the artist from that of mere craftsman to superstar. Additional topics of discussion include the influence of the capitalist economics on artistic production, domestic art perceptions of the nude figure in religious paintings, the relationship between art and science, and the writings of Machiavelli. (5 units) 121. Venice and the Other in Renaissance Concentrates on the art and architecture of the Venetian Republic from approximately 1400--1650 CE, specifically the visual culture produced by and/or associated with ethnic and social groups excluded from the highest echelons of Venetian society. Areas of inquiry include Muslim merchants living in the city, construction of the Jewish ghetto, Ethiopian servant community, courtesan culture, convent life, the material culture of exorcism, witchcraft, and dwarfism. (5 units) 123. The Global Renaissance The \"Renaissance\" has traditionally been viewed as a period of artistic and cultural development associated almost exclusively with the Italian peninsula in the 15th and 16th century. This same tradition privileges \"high art\"---that is, painting, sculpture, and architecture over other forms of visual culture. This course seeks to reassess these notions by considering Italian Renaissance art within the context of early modern globalism. This reexamination likewise mandates a consideration of a broader spectrum of objects, including gemstones, glassware, and textiles. Topics such as the relationship between Michelangelo, Leonardo, and the Ottoman architect Sinan, the collection of Aztec feather paintings by the Medici family, and the influence of Egyptian mosque architecture on Venetian palace design will be examined from an interdisciplinary perspective.

Wheeler Assistant Professors:Ian Carter-O'Connell, Benjamin Stokes Senior Lecturer: Steven L. Fedder The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers three baccalaureate degrees: the bachelor of science in chemistry, the bachelor of science in biochemistry, and the bachelor of arts in chemistry. The curriculum is accredited by the American Chemical Society (ACS), the professional organization for chemistry. The program prepares students for further work in chemistry or biochemistry, either in graduate school or as professional chemists. In addition, a chemistry or biochemistry degree is excellent preparation for careers in medicine, dentistry, law, engineering, business, and teaching. A minor in chemistry is also available. All bachelor of science degrees provide graduates with the background necessary to begin a career in chemistry or biochemistry at industrial and governmental laboratories, for admission to institutions offering graduate degrees in chemistry and biochemistry, and for admission to medical and dental schools as well as other professional programs in the health professions. The chemistry major provides equal training in all the disciplines in chemistry, and the biochemistry major combines training in chemistry with additional coursework in cell and molecular biology. The bachelor of science ACS-certified degrees meet all recommended standards for chemists and biochemists as mandated by the ACS. The bachelor of arts degree allows students the most freedom in choosing electives, and therefore is an excellent program for pre-medical or pre-teaching students. Students with a strong interest in the liberal arts or who wish to pursue subjects outside the standard science curriculum will benefit from this degree. The bachelor of arts degree can be effectively combined with a pre-law or business curriculum to provide excellent preparation for law or business careers in the technology sector. Undergraduate research is a critical component of our degrees and most of our majors conduct research in collaboration with faculty mentors. Research in the department has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, the Dreyfus Foundation, the Beckman Foundation, and Research Corporation for Science Advancement. Majors in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and public health science participate in faculty research projects through CHEM 182, 183, and 184. In addition, advanced students have opportunities for part-time employment assisting faculty in laboratory and related teaching activities. The chemistry and biochemistry curricula are designed to be flexible in the sequence of upper-division coursework so as to allow students to participate in study abroad programs. Students interested in study abroad should meet with a faculty advisor to plan the junior and senior year courses as early as possible in their academic careers.

Bachen, Justin Boren, Hsin-I Cheng, Rohit Chopra, Sreela Sarkar Assistant Professors: David Jeong, Marquette Jones, Nicole Opper, Chan Thai Senior Lecturers: Katharine Heintz, Barbara Kelley, Gordon Young Lecturers: Lisa Davis, Andrew W. Ishak, Emily Reese The Department of Communication offers a program of studies leading to a bachelor of arts in communication. The major prepares students for a wide variety of graduate studies and for careers in the communication industry. A minor in digital filmmaking or journalism is also available. Students explore the theories, research methods, responsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass communication, interpersonal communication, strategic communication, and computer-mediated communication. The major also integrates theory with practice. We help students to apply their knowledge of the communication process to create their own speeches, films, television programs, journalism, Web content, and communication and marketing campaigns. Many of our students go directly to work in these fields after graduation. Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students integrate courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often, students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related disciplines. To encourage students to explore global studies, the department accepts up to two approved study abroad courses toward completion of the communication course requirements, usually as upper-division electives. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus media organization or other communication-related institution. Internships may be counted for course credit as a department elective. In their senior years, all communication majors synthesize their learning in the department by completing a scholarly thesis (on any aspect of communication) or an applied capstone project (in journalism, digital filmmaking, or strategic communication/public relations). Theses and capstone projects, which typically embody students' most advanced work, are suitable for submission as part of applications for graduate school and jobs. Students interested in communication, including nonmajors, enjoy a wealth of co-curricular opportunities. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media, including the student newspaper, radio station, and yearbook. Practicum courses allow students to gain academic credit for working in student media. Santa Clara Debate, one of the oldest forensic programs in continuous operation on the West Coast, provides a challenging and rigorous co-curricular activity designed to develop public speaking skills, critical thinking, and public policy analysis. Policy debate participants are eligible to apply for merit scholarships. All courses taken to fulfill requirements for the major or minor must be four or five units and must be taken for a letter grade, not on a pass/no pass basis. Practicum courses, numbered 190 through 195, do not count toward fulfillment of the communication major or minor.

This practical discipline provides insights into important issues such as the determinants of wealth and poverty; unemployment, inflation, international trade, and economic growth; and success and failure in the marketplace. The rigorous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Economics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting. Students considering graduate study in economics leading to a master's or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appropriate course of study.

While there is no single, universally accepted definition of sustainable development, a central goal of this course is that each student will come away with the ability to understand the key elements that distinguish different discourses on this subject. Prerequisite: ENVS 22 recommended. (5 units) 147. International Environment and Development Examines the intersection of environment and development in the developing world. Students will explore meanings and measures of development as well as international institutions that influence development and environmental policy. Conceptual frameworks for addressing human-environmental relationships, including globalization, famine and hunger, sustainable development, population-poverty interactions, and gender will be explored. Specific topics to be covered include deforestation, water use, conservation and development, oil extraction, and urbanization. Prerequisite: ENVS 22 or by permission of instructor. (5 units) 148. Solar Revolution Solar energy is more than just photovoltaic (PV) arrays on a roof. Learn about different types of PV technologies as well as passive solar design, and concentrated solar thermal (making power at the level of a conventional power plant!). Find out the key technological, environmental, and economic issues, and what it would take to employ solar energy to greatly decrease our reliability on fossil fuels. Students will use the United States as well as numerous examples in developed and developing countries as case studies. Prerequisite: ENVS 21, 22, 23, or 80. (5 units) 149. African Environment and Development Students will gain an in-depth understanding of Africa's diversity and dynamism, considering how people and environments have interacted through space and time. We will examine Africa's social, cultural, economic, political, and environmental systems to understand Africa's trajectory of development. Also listed as POLI 146. (5 units) 150. Political Ecology Explores political ecology as a field of study and as a critical tool to analyze environmental issues. Focuses on going beyond simplified explanations about environmental problems, tracing environmental change to broader political, economic, and cultural issues. Topics explored will include land degradation, conservation through parks and reserves, land use conflicts, science and power, social movements, urban pollution, and public health. Course readings include case studies from across the globe to examine how political ecology research engages issues and how it offers critical insights needed to address environmental problems. Challenges students to critically examine their own interpretations and understandings of today's most important environmental issues. Prerequisite: ENVS 22 or by permission of instructor. (5 units) 151. Restoration Ecology L&L The science and practice of restoring degraded ecosystems, from tidal marshes to coral reefs, with an emphasis on California habitats and local management challenges. Students will develop skills in reading scientific literature, interpreting data, and taking field measurements. Students will learn how to monitor the success of restoration projects at meeting the goals of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Laboratory and fieldwork 30 hours. Saturday field trip may be required. Also listed as BIOL 151. Prerequisite: BIOL 1C or both ENVS 21 and ENVS 23. (5 units) 153. Conservation Science Conservation is a scientific enterprise and a social movement that seeks to protect nature, including Earth's animals, plants, and ecosystems. Conservation science applies principles from ecology, population genetics, economics, political science, and other natural and social sciences to manage and protect the natural world. Conservation is all too often seen as being at odds with human well-being and economic development. This course explores the scientific foundations of conservation while highlighting strategies to better connect conservation with the needs of a growing human population. We will examine whether conservation can protect nature, not from people, but for people. Also listed as BIOL 153. Prerequisite: BIOL 1C, or both ENVS 21 and 23. (5 units) 155. Environmental and Food Justice This course unites two vibrant fields for academic study and arenas for social, political, and ecological action. Environmental justice as a principle affirms the right of all people to healthy livable communities. Environmental injustice occurs when environmental benefits and burdens are unevenly distributed along the lines of identity, including race, class, and/or nationality. Food justice research addresses inequalities in food access and studies the patterns, causes, and solutions associated with increasing hunger and obesity among eaters and the accumulation of environmental costs in agricultural landscapes. After reviewing several seminal studies in environmental and food justice, this class delves into case studies in California and Central America. Learners will conduct a major research project, participate in team-based collaborations, and engage local communities as part of this course. Prerequisite: ENVS 22 or 79. (5 units) 156. General Ecology L&L Quantitative study of the interrelationships of organisms with their biotic and abiotic environments. Emphasis on population dynamics, interspecific relationships, community structure, and ecosystem processes. Laboratory and field work 30 hours, including one weekend field trip.

Emphasis on quantitative tools, including trend analysis, population viability analysis, and population genetics. Laboratory and fieldwork involve exercises with local plants and animals, as well as computer exercises using data for endangered species. Laboratory and field work 30 hours. Prerequisite: BIOL 1C. Also listed as BIOL 150. (5 units) 160. Water Resources L&L This course covers fundamental concepts in hydrology and water resources management such as precipitation, runoff, and infiltration, flow in streams and aquifers, floods and droughts, water budgets, water delivery systems and stream restoration, water cycling, use, treatment, pollution, and conservation. Interactions between water and human societies, ecosystems, agriculture, natural resources, and climate are explored through domestic and international case studies. Course concepts are reinforced through indoor and outdoor class and laboratory exercises and field trips. Laboratory 30 hours. Prerequisite: ENVS 21 or 23, or by permission of instructor. (5 units) 161. Water Security UN millennium development goals include access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation for all people, yet in many places those have remained an elusive goal. Water security invokes the idea of risk, but also of action, and resonates with governments, managers, academics, donors, activists, and organizations. In this course we will analyze frameworks and approaches to water security. Through critical evaluation of the recent literature and principles from the fields of environmental science and studies, students will gain perspectives on barriers and solutions to safeguarding access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, ecosystems, and human well-being. This class satisfies the requirements for an upper division elective in the environmental sciences, a natural science elective for environmental studies majors, and an advanced writing course for the University Core. (5 units) 166. Climate Change: Past to Future L&L Human-caused changes to the climate system are now widely accepted and expected to have great effects on physical, biological, and human systems from sea level rise to human disease, ocean acidification and mass extinction. We will explore climate change in three broad units: (1) foundational aspects of the climate system such as Earth's energy balance, greenhouse effect, carbon cycle, and circulation of the oceans and atmosphere; (2) evolution of the climate system throughout Earth's history; and (3) impacts, vulnerabilities, and solutions for modern climate change. Students will model Earth's energy balance, examine Earth's carbon and water cycles in the field and lab, experimentally determine sea level rise with water isotopes, and use climate models to predict future changes. Lectures and discussions of current scientific literature and government documents will be motivated by student interest. Laboratory 30 hours. (5 units) 185. Garbology This class follows the path of our waste products as they are landfilled, burned, treated, recycled, reused, dumped on minority communities, or shipped abroad. Building on basic chemical and biological principles, we explore the ultimate fate of organic and inorganic waste. We look to the past and to other societies to better understand how we got to this throw-away society and what we can learn from past practices and other cultures. We explore sustainable solutions including new efforts to reduce our waste such as \"extended producer responsibility,\" design-for-disassembly, green chemistry, and zero waste. Students will also learn how to utilize the \"life cycle analysis\" approach as a basis for those daily decisions such as paper versus plastic. Prerequisite: ENVS 23. (5 units) 195.

(1--5 units) "},"chapter-3/EthnicStudies.html":{"url":"chapter-3/EthnicStudies.html","title":"Ethnic Studies","keywords":"","body":"Ethnic Studies Department Professor Emeritus: Stephen Fugita Professors: James S. Lai, Anna Sampaio (Department Chair) Associate Professors: Anthony Q. Hazard Jr. Assistant Professor: Jesica Fern√°ndez Lecturer: Allia Griffin Ethnic studies is a compelling and dynamic discipline devoted to the critical examination of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and intersecting modes of inequality particularly as manifest in the experiences of historically marginalized populations. In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities while building on the critical studies of racialization and resistance with research and courses across a broad field including education, economic development, identity and empowerment, immigration, labor and employment, media, music, and popular culture, multiracial communities, sovereignty, transnational networks, voting rights, and political representation. Ethnic studies focuses on the roles and experiences of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations with particular attention paid to African Americans/Blacks, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans, Chicanas/os/xs and Latinas/os/xs and American Indian/Native Americans within the framework of the United States and within transnational networks. Coursework also emphasizes the comparative interaction between various racial/ethnic groups and cross-national approaches to their histories, cultural productions, and socioeconomic and political experiences. As an academic department, Ethnic Studies fosters interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of experts of critical racial and ethnic studies, while serving as teachers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. The Ethnic Studies Department strives to make connections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change, and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. The Ethnic Studies Department serves as a resource for students, faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in examining race and ethnicity and its intersections with multiple modes of inequality including class, gender, citizenship, and nationality. The department offers students the option to complete a major in ethnic studies (bachelor of science) or a minor in ethnic studies. The major provides students with advanced and concentrated training in racial and ethnic studies with coursework clustered in the upper division around six themes: Community Engagement and Social Movements; Race, Law, Politics, and Policy; Intersectionality and Hybridity; Inequality and Education; Immigration, Transnationalism, and Globalization; and Social and Cultural Analysis. Both the stand alone major and minor enhance a student's employment opportunities in business, community service work, education, law, medicine, social work, politics, and government. For those considering graduate school, the majors provide a foundation for graduate studies particularly for those who seek to become university professors and researchers with a specialization in a variety of issues and policies impacting racial and ethnic communities. Requirements for the Major In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum, students pursuing the major in ethnic studies must complete the following requirements: ETHN 5 Two courses from ETHN 10, 20, 30, 40, 80 One of the following breadth electives: ANTH 86, 90; DANC 62; ENGL 35, 35G, 36, 37, 38, 39, 69; ETHN 11, 12, 21, 22, 25, 35, 36, 41, 50, 51, 55, 59, 60, 65, 69, 70, 75, 95, 96; MUSC 20; RSOC 91; THTR 14, 65 Six upper-division courses selected from at least four of the following six categories: Community Engagement and Social Movements (ETHN 112, 122, 123, 125,132, 133, 142, 149, 153, 160, 163, 166, 171) Race, Law, Politics and Policy (ETHN 120, 126, 127, 149, 153, 155, 178, 180 ) Intersectionality and Hybridity (ETHN 121, 129, 141, 151, 152, 154, 157, 163, 167, 169) Inequality and Education (ETHN 150, 157, 161, 167) Immigration, Transnationalism, and Globalization (ETHN 112, 120, 126, 127, 138, 170, 171, 172, 178, ) Social and Cultural Analysis (ETHN 124, 128, 130, 131, 132, 135, 136, 141, 144, 145, 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 172) Note: No class can be used to fulfill more than one category.

Asian American Literature Also listed as ENGL 38. For course description see ENGL 38. (4 units) 50. Introduction to Filipino American Studies Explores mainstream representations of the Filipino American community. Twentieth-century works written by and about Filipino Americans, with an emphasis on four relevant themes: the legacy of Spanish Colonialism and American Imperialism; U.S. politics and the history of Filipino American activism and resistance; problems of identity as it relates to class, gender/sexuality, mixed heritages, and generational differences; and Filipino Americans and popular culture. (4 units) 51. Introduction to the South Asian Experience in the United States This course addresses mainstream representations of the South Asian American community. Students will read 20th-century works, written by and about South Asian Americans, with an emphasis on the following relevant themes: the history of South Asian immigrants to the United States; U.S. politics and the history of South Asian American activism and resistance; problems of identity as it relates to class, gender/sexuality, mixed heritages, and generational differences; South Asian Americans and popular culture; and the future of South Asian Americans in the United States and the reverse brain drain to India. (4 units) 55. Cross-Racial Electoral Politics Examination of the historical and contemporary political movements among the major minority groups in the United States since the 1960s. The origins and goals of the Black Power movement, the Chicana/o movement, the Asian American movement, and the Native American movement will be focused on during the quarter. Each of these movements embodies similar and different trails with regard to their respective group's quest for political power and elected representation. Due to contemporary immigration trends, Latinas/os/xs and Asian Americans have challenged the black-white paradigm that has traditionally defined U.S. racial politics in local and state-level politics. The result, in some instances, has been interracial competition and conflict at these levels. The necessary elements needed to build and to sustain multiracial coalitions along with what the political future holds for these minority groups will be addressed. Also listed as POLI 55.

(4 units) 80. Introduction to the Study of the MENA Diaspora This course is an interdisciplinary survey of the contemporary racialization of the Middle Eastern/North African Diaspora in the US. Through critical readings, class discussions, and films, students will have the opportunity to develop a solid academic foundation for understanding contemporary writings and lived experiences of MENA Americans in the US. (4 units) 95. African American Independent Filmmakers This class provides an in-depth analysis and historical overview of independent African American filmmakers who made significant contributions to the genre of film. We will examine how African American filmmakers used film as a medium to heighten the consciousness of their audience, combat negative stereotypes, give voice to marginalized or underrepresented groups, and raise social awareness about issues affecting their diverse communities. Using film and text, we will read, discuss, and write about paradigms that lead to inequity and injustice. Specifically, we will examine the intersection of gender, race, and class, and note how these dynamics are illustrated in the cinema of African Americans. We will also understand how African American filmmakers were able to rise above adversity and hone and sustain their art, while confronting their myriad oppressions. (4 units) 96. Race, Class, and Culture through Film Explores how filmmakers who are concerned about racism portray the politics, history, and culture of people of African descent. Examines how this medium can humanize subjects who are often objectified and exploited and give voice to communities whose perspectives and opinions have been historically excluded from mainstream discourses. Considers how films can interrogate the physical, cultural, and sometimes, psychological brutality of racist practices, as well as the ways that racism intersects with other forms of marginalization related to class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. The content, production, and distribution of these cinematic portraits illuminate the political philosophies, hybrid cultures, and emancipating collective action of black communities. Integrates students in faculty research by involving students in a documentary film project about the relationship between the social movements for African liberation and black power.

Throughout the class we will compare and contrast their experiences being mindful of the intersecting differences of ethnicity, race, sex, gender, class, and age that alter the composition and opportunities of these communities. The class will highlight the political development of these populations, focusing particular attention on their relationship to both European and American colonization and expansion, patterns of immigration and incorporation, discrimination and obstacles to political empowerment, and mobilization for change. (5 units) 126. Latina/o/x Immigrant Detention and Incorporation in the Age of Terrorism This class will examine shifts in immigration politics with specific focus on the largest population of immigrants in the United States, namely Latinas/os/xs. In the course of this examination, we will pay particular attention to changes occurring after 1996 and the increasing scrutiny of both documented and undocumented immigrants that has led to surges in the numbers of immigrants detained, apprehended, incarcerated, and deported. We will be mindful of the gendered, class, and racialized dynamics at work in the development and execution of new immigration policy, and we will examine the effect of these shifts on concepts of citizenship. In the end, the course will compel students to consider the moral, political, and legal implications of an immigration policy focused disproportionately on enforcement and challenge them to find comprehensive alternatives. (5 units) 127. Race and Mass Incarceration This course is an introduction to the development and contemporary expansion of the Prison-Industrial Complex, with particular attention to the disproportionate incarceration of individuals of color.

Malcolm and Martin This course explores the lives, philosophies, and political activism of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. In an effort to complicate the violence/non-violence paradigm, which has often pitted the two men as political opponents, this course seeks to uncover the long trajectory of the philosophical development and political activism of both men through the end of each of their lives, in 1965 and 1968 respectively. Both figures lives and activism are situated within the black freedom movement of the 20th century, which was both transnational and global. As such, this course attempts to locate these two figures within various iterations of black nationalism, civil right activism, anti-colonialism, and Black Power. Also listed as HIST 168. (5 units) 135. African Americans in Postwar Film This course examines the presence of African Americans in mainstream Hollywood films during the postwar period. How did Hollywood representations of African Americans change after World War II? What shifts and continuities occurred during the postwar period? And how did those changes reflect the ebbs and flows of civil rights activism through the 1970s? The goal of this course is to gain a deeper understanding of broader social and historical change by engaging the politics of race through a core aspect of American popular culture. Also listed as HIST 185. (5 units) 136.

Starting with the era of silent film and through an analysis of race, ethnicity, gender, and class, we will examine how Asian Americans have been portrayed on the screen over time, as well the ways they have participated in Hollywood and independent productions as both performers and filmmakers. Class lectures and readings will address the social contexts of these productions and provide tools for interpreting visual culture. By studying media as sites of knowledge, we will develop a critical understanding of how ideas of and about Asian Americans are constructed, perpetuated, and contested. (5 units) 145. Studies in Asian American Literature Also listed as ENGL 138. For course description see ENGL 138. (5 units) 149. Civil Rights and Anti-Colonial Movements This course examines the connections between two historical developments often treated separately: the U.S. civil rights struggle and African anti-colonial movements. By placing these two movements in a transnational framework, the course explores the global challenge to the racialized world order of the 19th and early 20th century. How did the civil rights struggle gain momentum in the aftermath of World War II? What was the longer history and role of \"black nationalism\" and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? What were the connections between the civil rights movement and contemporary independence movements in Africa and Asia? One of the central goals of the course is to show how we can expand our understanding of U.S. history by reaching beyond the interaction between the U.S. government and other nation-states to examine political and cultural change. Also listed as HIST 153. (5 units) 150. Urban Education and Multiculturalism This course takes a critical multicultural approach to understanding urban education, encouraging a connection between theory and personal experience and observations. With a focus on schools in large urban contexts, this course centralizes the experiences of low-income, students of color. Race and class will be two critical lenses with which we will examine (1) the historical context of educational inequality, (2) current issues of educational inequity, and (3) the movement towards educational justice. Students should leave the course with a stronger understanding of the social and historical foundations of U.S. education. (5 units) 151. Race, Class, and Gender in the United States Also listed as SOCI 153 and WGST 115. For course description see SOCI 153. (5 units) 152. Multiracial Identities This course focuses on multiracial identity constructs in African American and Asian American literature. Using journey as a metaphor, the course seeks to define \"movement\" and \"place\" in contexts where physical, spiritual, voluntary, or forced journeys contribute to the transformative possibilities of race, class, gender, and identity. (5 units) 153. Minority Politics in the United States Also listed as POLI 153. For course description see POLI 153. (5 units) 154.

Documentary Making for Social Justice This creative course provides students the opportunity to write, dissect, and produce their own 10-minute documentaries that are committed to social justice. In addition to producing their own films, students will examine how documentary filmmakers use film as a medium to heighten the consciousness of their audience, combat negative stereotypes, give voice to marginalized or underrepresented groups, and raise social awareness about issues affecting their diverse communities. Reading film as \"text\"---complete with their own arguments, aesthetic concerns, social, political, and historical influences---we will understand how documentaries are used to illumine disparities or confront issues of inequity and injustice. Specifically, we will examine the intersection of gender, race, class, spirituality, and sexuality, and note how these dynamics function in film to enlighten our global community. Writers in this course will be moved from idea to script and, ultimately, film. (5 units) 161. Creating Diverse College-Going Communities In this course, students will develop an understanding of diversity issues in college access, reflect on their own experiences, utilize this knowledge to develop workshop curriculum to enhance college-going, and then implement this curriculum in high school classrooms as a community-based learning opportunity. This course introduces students to the background of colleges and universities in the United States, (including history, institutional types, and diverse student representation), then explores the many factors that influence college access and experiences in college (including class, race, gender, first-generation college student status, financial aid, and admissions processes). Students will reflect on their own college application and selection process and their experiences in college. Using this knowledge, students will engage in community-based learning (CBL) in which they provide college-related tutoring, mentoring, and workshops for high school students. (5 units) 162. Diversity and the Media This course focuses on the complex, changing, dynamic, and powerful relationships between dominant and underrepresented groups in society, the mass media, and broader social contexts; and discusses media representations of social groups, contexts of media production, and media use among underrepresented groups. The concepts of hegemony, power, social construction, and intersectionality are vital for understanding these relationships, and vital for the course. The course connects to the field of cultural studies in that it focuses on the everyday uses of symbolic forms and aims to make students aware of, and sensitive to, some of the dynamics connected with media images, symbolic power, and the production of meaning in today's world. Students are encouraged to formulate, question, and put into context, their own versions of reality. Also listed as COMM 121A. (5 units) 163. Multiracial Communities in Central California This course will examine the process of racialization in various communities throughout California and uncover how various ethno-racial groups within these communities live, work, and thrive together in their specific locales. This course will begin by interrogating definitions of community, spatial geography, political economy, as well as attempting to understand social attitudes about race and racism. Then we will examine various cities as case studies to understand the different ways multiracial communities formed. The end goal is to understand the nuances of how multiracial communities, both urban and rural, developed and inscribed meaning onto the geography of California. (5 units) 164. Popular Music, Race, and American Culture Also listed as MUSC 134. For course description see MUSC 134. (5 units) 165. Community-Based Research Methods Provides students with the epistemological, theoretical and ethical foundations for engaging in community-based research methodologies with ethnically and culturally diverse communities. Students will examine decolonizing and anti-oppressive methodologies toward engaging in social justice and participatory action research. This course is designed to equip students with the skills and abilities to engage in community-based, action-oriented and collaborative research projects. The goal is for students to think critically and reflexively, while examining, reflecting and re/deconstructing how research methods and knowledge are reproduced. More specifically, this course engages students in community-based projects where knowledge is co-produced in collaboration with communities of color, who are most affected social structural issues, and well positioned to identify and address injustices through direct-actions and/or deconstructing systems of power and oppression. This course is exclusively for ethnic studies majors and minors. (5 units) 166. Race and Religion in the United States Also listed as RSOC 184. For course description see RSOC 184. (5 units) 167.

For course description see SOCI 180. (5 units) 172. Whiteness Studies in the 21st Century Explores the impact of immigration to the United States, particularly the effect of the immigration reform law of 1965 that resulted in large increases in immigration to the United States particularly from Latin America and Asia. This wave of immigrants and their U.S.-born children have significantly changed the fabric of American society. Examines case studies of immigrants and the second generation from Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and Haiti using a comparative sociological perspective. Also listed as HIST 183. (5 units) 173. Social Stratification Also listed as SOCI 132. For course description, see SOCI 132. (5 units) 178. Race and World War II World War II stands as one of the most explosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the postwar world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of \"race\" in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178. (5 units) 180. Race, Voting, Campaigns, and Elections This class examines how the traditional vehicles of American political participation -- namely voting, campaigns, and elections -- have been racialized throughout American history and the particular impacts and responses among African Americans and Latinas/os/xs. As part of this examination we look closely at the participation of racial and ethnic minorities in various forms of electoral activity (as both voters and candidates), we analyze enduring obstacles to their political empowerment (both structural and resource constraints), and highlight efforts to remove those barriers. A critical examination of the upcoming national elections will feature prominently throughout this course and students will have the opportunity to examine local elections more closely through an original research project designed to study the intersection of race and voting in San Jose, California. (5 units) 184. Seminar - Women of Color in the United States (new starting Fall 2020) Explores the historical and present-day issues for women of color in the United States inclusive but not limited to key topics such as sexuality, family, work, media, and activism. Students will examine the impact of racism, sexism, heterosexism, and classism on African American, Asian American, Chicana/Latina, and Native American women in the United States. Using an interdisciplinary approach, students will also investigate their shared experiences as well as their differences. Also listed as WGST 112. (5 units) 185. Seminar - U.S. Politics: Racial and Ethnic Politics Also listed as POLI 195DW. For course description see POLI 195DW. (5 units) 186. Seminar - Contemporary Latino Immigration Issues This class creates a seminar version of ETHN 120 Mexican Immigration to the U.S. (see description above) by covering the same topics but focusing outcomes on producing original student research (either paper or project) and highlighting student participation and presentations through weekly readings and other course material. (5 units) 187. Seminar - Youth Activism & Contemporary Social Movements Youth Activism & Contemporary Social Movements examines current social movements catalyzed and led by young people. The course specifically examines youth community organizing and youth activism as a context for social justice work that parallels, yet differs from the Civil Rights Movements of the 1960s. In this course, we engage an intersectional analysis of race, age, and other markers of identity and difference. Through this perspective we will examine the contributions and role of young people in contemporary 21st-century social movements from the 1960s through the present that have contributed to contemporary youth activisms. Within a U.S. context, social movements have often been grouped into three different time periods: the Civil Rights Movement, the post-1960s, and the contemporary social movements. The thematic organization of these periods reflects the different struggles experienced by social groups within societies, and the varied approaches and mechanisms through which communities and young people organized. Although these social movements and waves of political activism are characterized and shaped by the timeframe of their unique sociopolitical context, there are similarities across all periods. One similarity across these times frames concerns the significant leadership and activism of young people‚Äîchildren, youth, and young adults‚Äîto resist and challenge structures of power and systems of oppression. From Anti-Islamophobia movements to Black Lives Matter to Undocumented & Unafraid to LGBTQ and women‚Äôs rights movements to the institutionalization of ethnic studies curricula and the ending of gun violence in schools‚Äîall of these movements underscore the power of young people. (5 units) 188. Seminar - Civil Rights and Anti-Colonial Movements This course examines the connections between two historical developments often treated separately: the U.S. civil rights struggle and anti-colonial movements across the globe. By placing these movements in a transnational framework, we will explore through readings and the production of an original research paper, the global challenge to the racialized world order of the modern world. What was the longer history and role of Black Nationalism and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? How did women contribute to the longer struggle against white supremacy in both the United States and colonial world? The central goal of the course is to expand our understanding of anti-racist struggle by moving beyond the formal boundaries of the United States of America in the 20th and 21st centuries. (5 units) 194. Peer Educator in Ethnic Studies Peer educators in ethnic studies work closely with a faculty member to help students in an ethnic studies course understand course material, think more deeply about course material, benefit from collaborative learning, and/or to help students enjoy learning. Enrollment is by permission of the instructor. (2 units) 195. Advanced Seminar in Critical Race Theory and Methods This course serves as an introduction to several of the methods used in advanced research in critical race and ethnic interdisciplinary research. The course will examine a range of theoretical and applied topics in research methods including: debates in epistemology, objectivity, interdisciplinary, and intersectionality; how to formulate a research design (from research question to presentation of findings); and applications of specific methodological tools such as interviews, participant observation, biography, content analysis, experimental design, and survey research. This course is exclusively for ethnic studies majors and minors. (5 units) 196. Praxis and Practitioners of Critical Racial and Ethnic Studies This class is organized around a weekly presentation, lecture, film, or other engagement by a local, regional, or national practitioner or activist whose work addresses key challenges and social justice work within racial and ethnic minority communities. The weekly presentation will serve as a focal point for critical analysis of contemporary racial and ethnic studies including pressing social, cultural, economic, and political issues within historically marginalized racial minority communities. Students are required to attend the weekly presentation and write a short reflect that summarizes their individual experiences. Prerequisite: Any Ethnic Studies course . (2 units) 197.

Survey of the foundations of each region. Patterns of connection and interdependence in world history. (5 units) 112. The Haitian Revolution in World History and Memory Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the \"age of democratic revolutions.\" This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island. This course will examine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, its near erasure from Western historical memory, and the literary and historical recovery of its importance in the 20th and 21st centuries. (5 units) 116. Sex and Gender in the Age of High Imperialism An examination of the role of sexuality and gender in the global expansion of European hegemony in the 19th and 20th centuries. Explores these themes through literature, historical scholarship, and film. Also listed as WGST 124. (5 units) 121. Human Rights and Humanitarianism From reading current news articles, one might surmise that the dignity of human beings and their inherent right freedom from undue suffering are self-evident, universally acknowledged goods that we should all pursue regardless of culture, place, or time. In fact, however, contemporary ideas about human rights, as well as humanitarian efforts (often pursued in far distant locales), have a particular history, one rooted in Western Enlightenment-era ideals of individual liberty and the brutal experiences of European imperialism. In this class, we will examine the histories and ideologies of human rights and humanitarianism, consider their underlying assumptions and power dynamics, and investigate the ways these histories relate to current legal, political, and humanitarian organizations and movements. (5 units) 123. History of Plagues, Epidemics, and Infections An exploration of scientific, social, cultural, political, and ethical contexts in the history of infectious diseases and epidemics. Particular attention is given to how the social framing of epidemiological thought has shaped responses by societies, how public health is an intrinsically political matter, and how we can envision the place played by social justice perspectives in fashioning global public health. (5 units) 124. History of Sexually Transmitted Diseases This course will survey the impact of sexually transmitted infections in a variety of national contexts, from the early modern period to recent times. The focus is mainly upon the history of classic venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea as well as more recently HIV/AIDS. How have medical debates about sexual contagion both influenced and been influenced by cultural conventions of blame, stigma, and moral judgment? Do representations of STDs provide a window into how a society organizes gendered expectations and constructs an image of deviant sexuality? How have responses to the problem of STDs changed over time? Can we examine these changes to better understand broader cultural adjustments to issues as diverse as prostitution and promiscuity, medical treatment and prophylaxis, and the politics of feminism, gay rights, and patients rights. (5 units) 138S. Gender and Rights in the Modern Era This seminar examines gender and rights in the contexts of citizenship, marriage and divorce, reproduction, health, the workplace, the body, and other categories of analysis with cases taken from modern Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Oceania.

(5 units) Lower-Division Courses: United States History 60. America's Immigrants This course will look at the history of immigration to the territory that makes up the United States of America. From the 18th century to events in the modern United States, we will explore the forces driving immigration and the process of acculturation in the United States. Varied case studies provide a starting point to better understand forced migration from Africa, 18th- and 19th-century immigration from Europe, migrant communities from Asia, and 20th- and 21st-century migrations from the Americas into the United States. Beyond understanding the factors driving immigration and the experiences of immigrant communities, this course explores the reception of migrants based on the influence of categories like race, gender, and religion. This class will ground you in the history and politics of immigration within the United States, but also will provide opportunities to reflect on the current debates around immigration, refugees, and other relevant contemporary issues. (4 units) 65. United States Political History: Democracy and Elections An exploration of U.S. politics from the creation of the American republic to the present. Themes studied will include the rise and demise of political party systems, clashes between rival interest groups, and the evolving relationship between Americans and their government.

(4 units) 70. The American Revolution Intensive study of the origins, progress, and culmination of the American Revolution to 1800. Emphasis is on the interplay between constitutional, social, economic and racial issues during the formative era of the United States. (4 units) 75. Natives and Newcomers: Early North America This course explores the history of North America from the eve of European colonization through the mid-18th century. It focuses on key social, economic, and political developments during the period and on cross-cultural interactions between (and among) Euro-American colonists, Native peoples, and peoples of African descent. While the course examines the settler colonies that subsequently became the United States, it also emphasizes the development of the rival French and Spanish empires in North America as well as the rise of pan-Native movements aimed at resisting colonial domination. This course strives to investigate North America's colonial past by considering a wide range of perspectives, reflecting the diversity of the various peoples who shaped its development. (4 units) 83. American Historical Geography America's geography is not just the stage for American History but an integral player in that history. This course explores how Americans' interactions with the continent's physical geography and built environments have shaped the nation from the pre-colonial era through the present day. Topics covered include: land use by Native peoples and settlers; U.S. expansion; immigration and internal migrations; urbanization, suburbanization, and gentrification; the conservation, preservation and environmental movements; and the response to natural and human-instigated disasters. Special emphasis is placed on topics related to California, and on the experiences of people marginalized by race, class and gender. (4 units) 84. United States Women's History Examination of the rich history of the changing social, economic, political, and intellectual life of women in the United States.

Malcolm and Martin This course explores the lives, philosophies, and political activism of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. In an effort to complicate the violence/nonviolence paradigm, which has often pitted the two men as political opponents, this course seeks to uncover the long trajectory of the philosophical development and political activism of both men through the end of each of their lives, in 1965 and 1968 respectively. Both figures' lives and activism are situated within the black freedom movement of the 20th century, which was both transnational and global.

ISP majors can lead to a bachelor of arts (B.A.) degree or a bachelor of science (B.S.) degree in social science. ISP does not offer a bachelor of science (natural science) degree option. All ISP majors must include a significant portion of courses taken in different disciplines. Such curricular diversity for ISP proposals is considered essential and defining of any ISP major. There is a strong preference for curriculum for the proposed ISP major to constituted from existing courses as opposed to independent study or directed readings courses. Study abroad courses can play an important role in an ISP major but are subject to limits. Courses taken abroad may be used to complete no more than four courses in the proposed plan of study. The student must identify and secure a faculty advisor who agrees to oversee the ISP major. All continuing SCU faculty members in good standing may serve as the academic advisor for an ISP major. The faculty member's area(s) or expertise must intersect with the student's proposed area of study. The faculty member is responsible for reviewing and approving the coursework (including possible electives and, if necessary, substitutions) and for providing the ISP student with at minimum annual advising during the spring quarter. The faculty advisor also agrees to complete the student's pre-graduation audit associated with the ISP major requirements.

Either major may be pursued with any of three principal goals: preparation for graduate studies leading to advanced degrees in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, operations research, or other fields; preparation for secondary school teaching of mathematics or computer science; or preparation for a research career in business, industry, or government. The major in mathematics may be taken with an emphasis in applied mathematics, financial mathematics, mathematical economics, or mathematics education. The emphasis in mathematics education is designed to prepare majors to take the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET). The major in computer science offers emphases specializing in algorithms and complexity, data science, security, software, or one of the student's choosing. Minors in mathematics or computer science are also available. The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science maintains a program for the discovery, encouragement, and development of talent in mathematics or computer science among undergraduates. This program includes special sections, seminars, individual conferences, and directed study guided by selected faculty members. Students are also encouraged to participate actively in research projects directed by faculty.

Our faculty of professional language educators and scholars integrates the teaching of language and culture throughout our curricula in order to enable students to communicate effectively across cultures; to appreciate cultural diversity; to interpret and discuss words, images, texts, and discourses in their sociocultural context; and to identify and analyze problems across cultural and national boundaries. With rigorous, high-quality programs deeply rooted in our Jesuit values and in the principles of the liberal arts experience, we offer students unique learning experiences, both in and out of the classroom, which enrich their personal lives, help them discern a future career path, and prepare them to compete locally and globally for a wide variety of careers. The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as degree programs leading to the Bachelor of Arts in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, and Spanish studies. Honors programs are available for French majors. The department offers minors in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, Japanese studies, and Spanish studies. Students can also combine language studies, especially Arabic, Chinese, or German with interdisciplinary minors (e.g., Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern studies; Asian studies; international studies; international business) or an individual studies major, which is offered by the College of Arts & Sciences. Many modern languages and literatures' courses fulfill Core requirements, including the Core Second Language requirement, Cultures & Ideas (1, 2, 3), Diversity, Civic Engagement, ELSJ, and several Pathways. All courses are open to any student with the requisite preparation. Some of these courses are offered in English as noted in the course descriptions. Courses offered in English do not fulfill the Core Second Language requirement. Students interested in taking a course in a language they have never previously studied should begin at the Elementary 1 level course. Those who wish to continue studying a language they studied prior to coming to SCU (or grew up speaking at home) must take a Placement Test to determine the most appropriate course for their level. This test is free and can be taken from any location. See the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures' website for more information on placement and proficiency testing. Study abroad is a valuable enhancement of the undergraduate experience and is particularly recommended for students pursuing a major or minor in a foreign language. Both the Global Engagement Office and the student's modern languages' advisor should be consulted to ensure appropriate integration of the work done abroad into the student's program of study.

Detective Short Story Detective fiction is considered by many as mere escapist entertainment.

Emphasis in Pre-Law Political science is one of the most common majors for pre-law students. After all, political science is the closest of all majors to the institutions and values with which law deals. The primary study of law is the state, and so too for political science. Additionally, the demands of political science courses (reading of complex texts, independent research, frequent class presentations, and demanding writing assignments) strengthen the analytical and communications skills that the practice of law requires. Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include a variety of courses from both inside and outside of the political science department. At most, six courses are required: three within the political science department and three from outside the political science department, although many of these courses fulfill other Core and political science major requirements.

McLean, Sarita Tamayo-Moraga, Sally Vance-Trembath Lecturers: Robert Scholla, S.J., Eugene Schlesinger The Department of Religious Studies offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of arts in religious studies. The department also offers a minor program for those who wish to concentrate in theological and religious studies. In keeping with the University's commitment to the Catholic faith tradition, the department offers a variety of courses in Scripture, history, and Catholic theology. Faithful to the Jesuit tradition of liberal education and engagement with other religions, the department offers a wide breadth of courses in various religious traditions and methodologies for the study of religion. The department also offers courses as part of the undergraduate Core Curriculum, at both lower-division and upper-division levels. Courses are clustered in three areas: Theology, Ethics, and Spirituality (TESP); Scripture and Tradition (SCTR); and Religion and Society (RSOC). Requirements for the Major In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in religious studies must complete the following departmental requirements: Three lower-division courses, one from each of the three areas (scripture and tradition; theology, ethics, and spirituality; and religion and society) Seven approved upper-division courses, including three designated religious studies seminars, with one in each of the three areas RELS 90 (Theories and Methods) RELS 197A and RELS 197B, a two quarter capstone seminar Requirements for the Minor Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in religious studies: One introductory-level religious studies course (1--19) Two intermediate-level courses (20--99) Four approved advanced-level courses (100--199), one of which must be a religious studies seminar. Of the seven courses, at least one must be from each of the three areas (scripture and tradition; theology, ethics, and spirituality; and religion and society). Lower-Division Courses: Scripture and Tradition (SCTR) 15. Texting God This course explores how people express their beliefs and how the technologies they use shape what they say. Focusing on Jewish and Christian \"texts\" (oral, written, visual, gesture), we'll examine the core beliefs that communities inscribe in them. We'll also consider how scriptural memes are reconstructed in the ongoing process of building cultural memory. We'll learn to analyze the rhetoric of various modes, and ask how changing technologies are altering our experience of text, scripture, and our relationships with God. (4 units) 19. Religions of the Book This course offers an introduction to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam with a study of their central texts, traditions and practices. We begin the course with a paradox: religion, that which in its literal sense \"binds\" or \"fastens together,\" is also that which often violently divides our world. As we examine the sacred texts of Jews, Christians, and Muslims (Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran), and various methods of interpreting them, our focus will remain on what is shared and what characteristically distinguishes between the monotheistic faiths. (4 units) 26. Gender in Early Christianity The history of early Christianity is often portrayed as a history of, by, and about men, despite clear indications that women played a prominent role in the early church. Introduces the construction of gender in antiquity, Jewish and Greco-Roman laws and customs, the biblical canon, and other Christian texts. Contemporary feminist perspectives will inform the discussion. Also listed as WGST 46. (4 units) 27. Digging Up Jesus This course examines the archaeological and literary evidence for Jesus. We'll use these primary \"texts\" to reconstruct the most plausible context for Jesus' work so that we can better understand the Gospel message, and learn the criteria for assessing whether he really said and did what the Gospels report. We'll also try to appreciate what the Gospel authors were doing in translating Jesus for their communities, just as we are doing ourselves with the historical approach of the course. (4 units) 28. Women In the Hebrew Bible This course explores stores, tropes, metaphors, poetry, and archaeology related to Hebrew Bible and Old Testament (HB/OT) women. Biblical studies methodologies and interdisciplinary lenses will be used to create access points with the material culture of the Ancient Near East (ANE), literary life and afterlives of biblical texts, as well as intersectional juxtapositions between ANE and contemporary lives of women. We will explore questions such as: Did God have a wife? Are the oldest parts of the HB/OT written by women? How many different ways can families be defined? How does the HB/OT promote leadership and women? Also listed as WGST 21. (4 units) 33. New Testament Narratives and Cinema Exploration of the stories that emerged with the Jesus event, their historicity, and their role in forming the early Christian communities. No previous knowledge of Christianity is needed. (4 units) 39. Biblical Women and Power Hero, villain, prophet, deviant---these are some of the power roles embodied by women in the Bible. Explores the exercise of power by biblical women in actual and figurative situations, in culturally positive and negative ways. Attention will be given to the continuing impact of such traditions for gender socialization in our world today. Also listed as WGST 47. (4 units) 48. Racializing Jesus The course explores the various ancient and contemporary ethnic representations of Jesus in art, film, regalia, and scripture. Although portraits of Jesus as a white, blue-eyed prophet, messiah, or rabbi haunt the popular cultural imagination, these often reflect the social location and racial biases of Western scholars. But, what if Jesus was black, non-white Latinx, Amerindian, Asian, or Jewish? And, why is contemporary scholarship still grappling with the idea of Jewish messiah? In order to map the politics of interpretation and presentation, the course seeks to \"radicalize\" Jesus by (1) exploring his Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (2) critically engaging sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; (3) interrogation of the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship; and (4) mapping the implications for marginalized ethnic communities and interracial dialogue. Key themes to explore include: race/ethnicity, colonialism and imperialism, the quests for historical Jesus, Hitler's Third Reich, eugenics, interreligious dialogue, police violence (Ferguson & Baltimore), and the polemic over Jesus' wife. (4 units) Upper-Division Courses: Scripture and Tradition (SCTR) 111. Bible and Ecology The Christian tradition has long been known for its anthropocentrism (human-centeredness), and traditional interpretations of the Bible have perpetuated the idea that God made the universe for humans, leaving other creatures to struggle amid both evolutionary forces and devastating human actions. What does the Bible really \"say\" about creation? What is the ethical significance of Jewish and Christian perspectives on the natural world, given our planet's threatened state? (5 units) 112. Martyrdom This course interrogates the role of sacred texts in legitimizing contemporary discourses on martyrdom or \"Dying in God.\" Crucial questions to explore include: What is martyrdom and its relationship to ancient notions of noble death? Why are notions of martyrdom so prevalent amongst Christian, Jewish, and Muslim fundamentalist groups today? How is the Torah, the Bible, and the Quran used to legitimate violence against the self and others? Key themes to explore include: notions of a noble death in antiquity, imperial violence (crucifixion), the book of Revelation, martyrdom in early Christianity, the Crusades, Jonestown, Branch Davidians, secularization, fundamentalism (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim), suicide bombing, school shootings, and the rise of the Islamic State. (5 units) 128. Human Suffering and Hope Explores issues of human suffering, justice, and belief in light of the biblical book of Job. Best for students interested in the creative arts, fiction writing, or community service. (5 units) 132. Apocalypse Now This course provides a comparative introduction to ideas/symbols/theologies of the \"End of the World\" in three major monotheistic religions. In view of the influence of apocalyptic thought upon contemporary American culture in particular, and Western and non-Western societies in general, this course prepares students to responsibly engage in discussions of \"End of the World\" scenarios and their religious, socioeconomic, political implications. Themes germane to the course include: colonialism, environmental disasters (e.g., Pentecostalism), and alternative religious violence (e.g., Jonestown). In order to help students explore and articulate these themes, the course will provide various interpretive approaches from the theories and methods in the study of religion. We conclude the course by reflecting on the influence of apocalyptic thought upon our own spirituality, hopes, and religious traditions. (5 units) 139. Bible in Contemporary Fiction and Film This course will examine representations of the Bible in contemporary fiction and film. The course aims to explore how contemporary literary and cinematic texts have used biblical sources, how these biblical sources have been adapted, and what these intertextual adaptations reveal about the concerns and purposes of their authors and readers/viewers. (5 units) 157. The Bible and Empire This course explores how politics shaped the Bible as it was being written and as it has been interpreted. Specifically, we will study how the experiences of empires in antiquity colored the assumptions about power, the portrait of God, and narratives of salvation that fill biblical books. We will also examine how the Bible is implicated in recent imperial adventures, both as a tool of European and American empires, and as a liberating resource for those they colonized. Also listed as WGST 153. (5 units) 158. Postcolonial Perspectives on the New Testament Introduces students to postcolonial critical theory and uses it to explore the political contexts of New Testament texts, raising new questions about the ethical implications of how we read these texts today. Also listed as WGST 147. (5 units) 165. Gender and Sexuality in Biblical Interpretations This course opens the Bible to critical readings from feminist and queer theory. It examines the original contexts of contested passages (creation, the destruction of Sodom, the role of women in early Christianity) as well as subsequent interpretation, and exposes the insights and ethical challenges that gender studies pose to these classic texts. Also listed as WGST 148. (5 units) 175. Wealth, Work, and the Gospel This course explores how Jews and Christians understood the significance of wealth and work in the Bible and in later interpretation of those texts. Beginning with the Jewish scriptures, we will probe the economic contexts of emerging beliefs and practices, and then trace how these traditions were reshaped in the New Testament, the early and medieval churches, and the Protestant Reformation. This course concludes with the rise of capitalism and a comparison of capitalist and Gospel values. (5 units) 198. Practicum (1--5 units) 199. Directed Reading and Research For religious studies majors only. (1--5 units) Lower-Division Courses: Theology, Ethics, and Spirituality (TESP) 2. Magicians, Athletes, and God An introduction to Catholic Christianity's notion of transcendence using fantasy literature to describe and inspect the selected Christian truth claims about reality: a personal God, grace, sin, doctrine, ritual, sacred texts, and the nature and role of authority. The course makes use of narratives to disclose the foundational concepts in Christian discourse. (4 units) 4. The Christian Tradition A theological examination of the Christian tradition covering such topics as religious experience and the meaning of God; Jesus in the Gospels; the development and history of the Christian churches; and the relevance of Christianity in the 21st century global world. (4 units) 16. Religion, Science, and Ecology Science and religion provide distinctive ways of seeing, knowing, and living in the world. Yet they are often seen as being in conflict---to the detriment of religious practice and concern for the natural world. Must religion and science compete? How might they come together to promote the flourishing of the universe and all its creatures? This course engages religious perspectives on science from the standpoint of the world's religions, exploring how religion and science might cooperate for the good of all life on a planet threatened by ecological degradation. (4 units) 22. Latinx Pentecostal Christianities The course begins with the historical background of the Azusa Street Revival and the development of Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianities in Latinx communities in the United States. Building on this historical background, students then explore the current-day structures and diverse practices of Latinx Pentecostal/Charismatic communities. Students will reflect on how Latinx Pentecostal/Charismatic religious and ethical principles apply to their own beliefs, whether they be Christian, another religion, agnostic, or atheist. (4 units) 26. Sustainable Theologies How do religious traditions, beliefs, and practices shape human attitudes toward earth and earth's creatures? Using scientific discussions of ecology and sustainability, this course critically evaluates religious and theological traditions' potential to promote the flourishing of life and sustainable living on a planet in peril. (4 units) 27.

Balthasar argues that logic and truth operate in the four areas of: (1) nature, (2) freedom, (3) mystery, and (4) participation. Is machine intelligence possible without incorporating these themes into its programming? By aligning the machine to each of these four broad concerns, will the machine then become not only self-conscious, but also, aware of the existence of a transcendent being?

Billingslea (William J. Rewak Professor), Barbara M. Fraser, Barbara A. Murray Associate Professors: Jerald R. Enos, Kimberly M. Hill, David J. Popalisky (Department Chair) Assistant Professor: Karina Guti√©rrez Senior Lecturers: Derek Duarte, Kristin Kusanovich, David Sword Lecturers: Jeffrey Bracco, Karyn Connell, Pauline Locsin-Kanter, Patt Ness, Brian Thorstenson, The Department of Theatre and Dance celebrates the creativity of the human spirit, offering a well-rounded education that leads to a bachelor of arts degree in Theatre Arts with emphasis in either theatre or dance. The department also offers minors in theatre, dance, theatre design and technology and musical theatre (an interdisciplinary minor offered in collaboration with the Department of Music). The program emphasizes academic rigor, artistic discipline, and creative expression. All students work closely with faculty and staff mentors. Majors fulfill all requirements set forth by the Undergraduate Core Curriculum, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Department of Theatre and Dance. Theatre and dance are distinct but related areas of emphasis. While each has its own set of disciplinary standards and academic requirements, students in each emphasis share some common courses (e.g., Introduction to Performance Collaboration, Defining the Performing Artist, etc.) The theatre emphasis offers coordinated courses in acting, design, theatre history, dramatic literature, technical production, directing, and playwriting. Students with this emphasis will have a broad foundation in theatrical practice and may choose to focus their study in any of the aforementioned areas. The dance emphasis offers coordinated classes in modern/contemporary dance, choreography, dance history, and provides additional training in ballet, jazz, hip-hop, and ethnic dance forms. Majors in either emphasis will complete their program with a senior project that demonstrates their proficiency in a chosen area. All students are encouraged to be creative in taking responsibility for their undergraduate education, working with advisors and mentors to plan programs that marry courses in their focus areas to other disciplines. Since courses in theatre and dance provide students with invaluable experience in collaboration, critical thinking, organizational management, and effective communication skills, they may profitably combine a major in theatre arts with a major (or minor) in almost any other discipline---especially English, music, communication, art, psychology, political science, history, or business. A degree in theatre arts prepares students for a variety of career options. Some students pursue graduate study in specialized focus areas so as to become professional theatre or dance artists and teachers. Others pursue careers in professional theatre or dance companies immediately after graduation. Still others have created their own theatre or dance companies or have ventured into the world of film, television, arts administration, education, and religious ministry. Many have used their performing arts experience to pursue careers in law, medicine, business, and marketing and development. The performance season, sponsored by the department, includes four faculty-directed plays and two dance concerts, in addition to student-directed plays and dance recitals. Participation in these productions is open to all members of the University community---students, faculty, and staff. Guest artists regularly direct, design, choreograph, and/or perform in productions with SCU students. Requirements for the Major In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum and College of Arts and Sciences requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in theatre arts must complete the following departmental requirements: Emphasis in Theatre THTR 8, 9, 10 and 30 One course from THTR 31, 32, 33 One course from DANC 40, 43, 46 THTR 41A, 42B One course from THTR 112, 113, 119, 161, 165, 167 DANC 159 or 189 THTR 185 Three approved 5-unit upper-division theatre or dance electives 4 units of THTR 39/139 Senior Project may be fulfilled by one of the following courses: THTR 192, 193, 195, 196, 197 (*see description below) Emphasis in Dance THTR 9, 10, and 30 One course each in ballet and jazz (one at the Intermediate level) DANC 48 DANC 49 DANC 67 DANC 143 and 146\\ Two courses from DANC 140, 141, 142, 145, 147, 148 DANC 162 or 166 DANC 159 or 189 4 units of THTR 39/139 Senior Project may be fulfilled by one of the following courses: DANC 192 or 193 (*see description below) *Senior Project: The Senior Project provides majors with the opportunity to demonstrate their progress in meeting the department learning objectives. In this capstone course, students will prepare and present a final project in an area of their choosing (e.g., acting, design, directing, playwriting, history, literature, dance choreography, performance etc.).

The minor offers students the opportunity to customize their interests through two emphases: (1) the Global Thematic Emphasis (GTE) in which students concentrate their coursework on highly individualized themes related to international or cross-cultural studies, or (2) the Area Studies emphasis in which students concentrate their coursework on selected geographic areas, Africa, Europe, or Latin America. The Global Thematic Emphasis (GTE) offers students the opportunity to examine broad international issues that transcend a single nation or geographic area. In the GTE, students focus on a topic such as poverty and development, global health, international law, international human rights, peace and conflict resolution, cross-cultural communication, international social justice in the arts, technology and globalization, the global dimensions of natural and physical sciences, diplomacy, and gender and society. Such subjects require systematic approaches distinct from the examination of single-nation or area studies. Some of the most compelling Global Thematic emphasis topics in recent years have included international law, global issues of sustainability, international women's rights, and community arts in the global context. The Global Thematic Emphasis is highly individualized and students are encouraged to develop a focus that relates to their broader interests. The Area Studies emphasis may include a focus on Africa, Europe, or Latin America. The Area Studies emphasis offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the cultures, languages, politics, and global challenges facing the region. The Area Studies emphasis with a focus on Africa also includes study of the African diaspora and related issues of slavery, colonialism, and globalization. Requirements for the Minor For the minor in international studies, students must complete the equivalent of four foundation courses, a capstone course, plus an emphasis course in either Global Thematic or Area Studies as follows: Foundation Courses Foreign Language: Two upper-division courses in a foreign language related to the chosen Global Thematic or Area Studies emphasis or the equivalent, as demonstrated through successful examination through the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures Social Science: Two relevant courses in anthropology, communication, political science, or sociology; one of which must be ANTH 3, COMM 107A, POLI 2, POLI 25, SOCI 133, or SOCI 134 Capstone A minimum of 20 contact hours in a class, academic internship, or community-based learning experience abroad. The course must include academic oversight and assessment. This requirement may be fulfilled by a minimum of one quarter study abroad related to the chosen Area Studies or Global Thematic emphasis. Students should communicate with the associate provost for International Programs to request approval for alternative capstone courses. Global Thematic Emphasis (GTE) Courses In addition to the foundation courses, students pursuing the Global Thematic emphasis must complete three courses, at least two of which must be upper division and no more than one of which may be in the student's academic major. Students develop their own theme and present a detailed proposal to the International Studies Committee for approval usually no later than the first quarter of their junior year.

Fedder Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. Most incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medicine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more attractive including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, public health professional, and others. A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by medical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the communication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school and in one's subsequent medical practice. Although Santa Clara does not have a pre-med major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. Most medical schools require: One year of general chemistry (CHEM 11, 12, and 13) One year of organic chemistry (CHEM 31, 32, and 33) One year of biology (BIOL 1A, 1B and 1C) One year of physics (PHYS 11, 12, and 13 or PHYS 31, 32, and 33) One year of mathematics, typically calculus (MATH 11 and 12), and a statistics course In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in biochemistry, genetics, and human physiology, which are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The combination of Core Curriculum requirements with the University's focus on community involvement and issues of diversity will prepare students well for the recently revised MCAT 2015, with its greater emphasis on social, economic, and psychological determinants of health. The choice of academic major is much less important than completing the coursework above; however, many pre-health students select a natural science major such as biology, biochemistry, chemistry, neuroscience, or public health science. Students should thoroughly examine the Pre-Health Advising website and should maintain regular contact with the pre-health advisor throughout their undergraduate years for assistance with adjusting to college academic rigor and social life; developing an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; achieving a balance between academics, social life, work, health community volunteering, and internships; selecting the relevant entrance examinations; and applying to graduate health science programs.

Early in their undergraduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors to help determine whether or not a career in law matches their particular interests and strengths. Consultation with a pre-law advisor familiarizes the student with the rigors of law school, the practice of law, the burden of law school debt, and the means to best secure employment as an attorney. Advisors will help formulate a program to prepare students for the complexity of the application process, including preparation for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Successful law school applicants come from a diversity of majors such as anthropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biology, and economics. However, to successfully prepare for the LSAT, students are advised to select courses that deepen reading comprehension and promote logical reasoning. Law school admissions officers generally recommend undergraduate preparation by selecting courses that demand discipline, analytical ability, research skills, close reading of texts, creativity, verbal skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of philosophy and political science offer a pre-law emphasis within the major (in philosophy, it is also available within the minor).

The FTP is managed through the Child Studies Program in the College of Arts and Sciences. Preparation for Multiple-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in elementary or middle school teaching generally earn a bachelor's degree before entering into a post-graduate teacher credential program. Students who would like to teach TK--8 (self-contained classroom) in California are strongly encouraged to select from majors such as psychology, child studies, or sociology within the College of Arts and Sciences, though any undergraduate major is acceptable. The undergraduate program of study, including the Core Curriculum, should encompass the range of subjects taught in grade school and include courses that have field-based learning placements in settings that directly serve school-aged children. The SCU undergraduate Core Curriculum provides a broad education in English, mathematics, science, social science, the arts, and humanities, all of which will be valuable preparation to become an elementary school teacher. Students are recommended to pursue the interdisciplinary minor in urban education to participate in undergraduate pre-teaching coursework. Those requirements can be found in the Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study section in this chapter. Students must demonstrate the subject matter competency component for the multiple-subject credential by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET) for Multiple Subjects. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills (see below for additional information on this requirement). Preparation for Single-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in secondary school teaching in a particular subject matter area are advised to fulfill the requirements of the academic major of their intended teaching specialization. California teaching credentials are available in the following subject areas: agriculture, art, biological sciences, business, chemistry, English, geosciences, health science, home economics, industrial and technology education, mathematics, music, physical education, physics, general sciences, social science, and world languages other than English. Students must demonstrate specific subject matter competency by passing the CSET in the subject area they desire to teach. Completing an undergraduate major in this subject area is not required but it is highly recommended. An undergraduate interdisciplinary minor in urban education is also recommended. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills (see below for additional information on this requirement). Requirements for Multiple-Subject and Single-Subject Credentials The minimum requirements for the multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential include: A bachelor's degree in a subject area from an accredited institution Demonstrated knowledge of the United States Constitution by completion of undergraduate coursework on the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution such as POLI 1, HIST 96A, or HIST 96B, or passage of an approved examination Demonstrated basic educational skills by completing one of the following: California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST); CSET: Multiple Subjects Plus Writing Skills Examination; CSU Early Assessment Program or the CSU Placement Examinations (English and Mathematics sections); Achieve Qualifying Score on the SAT or ACT; College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Examinations (English and Calculus or Statistics); Basic Skills Examination from a state other than California. Completion of an approved program of professional education, including field experience achieved through student teaching or internship Completion of a state-approved subject matter preparation program, or passage of the CSET, a subject-area competency examination, in the area one plans to teach For multiple-subject credential candidates only: Demonstrated knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading by passing the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA) examination Fifth-Year Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential can be completed as part of the Masters of Arts in Teaching and Teaching Credential (MATTC) program. This program requires a fifth year of study following the bachelor's degree and qualifies the student for a preliminary teaching credential. The MATTC program includes graduate coursework in educational foundations, curriculum design, teaching methods, and supervised student teaching. Bilingual authorization in Spanish is also available. Students seeking additional information regarding the MATTC program with a multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential should contact the Director of PreTeaching or the Graduate Admissions Office in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology.

This practical discipline provides insights into important issues such as the determinants of wealth and poverty; unemployment, inflation, international trade, and economic growth; and success and failure in the marketplace. The rigorous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Economics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting.

Harvard Business School cases give students the opportunity to learn from the most critical business and policy decisions of our times. Putting students in the role of decision-maker challenges them to understand the complexity of decision making and leadership, and begins to train them for their careers post SCU. Leadership Development Teams (LDTs) are small, mentored groups. The goal is for students to explore and share their authentic selves and develop the courage to live as their authentic selves in their careers and lives.

Development of students' decision-making and managerial skills are the major objectives of the Department of Marketing program, with special emphasis in innovation, high technology, retailing, and digital marketing. Marketing links a business to its markets and customers and acts as the eyes and the ears for a firm, helping managers to identify emerging market opportunities and anticipating customer needs and wants. It is also the firm's voice, handling communications with customers and deciding on advertising, sales, and social media messages. Finally, strategic marketing addresses competitive threats and opportunities, guiding a firm's efforts to deliver superior value. Because customer analysis and competitive advantage are so crucial to business success, a degree in marketing provides a solid foundation for a general management career leading to executive responsibilities. It can also provide the basis for a more focused career in such areas as advertising, retailing, sales, brand management, and market research. Requirements for the Major In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum and Leavey School of Business requirements for the bachelor of science in commerce degree, students majoring in marketing must complete the following departmental requirements: MKTG 182 and 183 (recommended to be completed in junior year, prior to electives) After completion of MKTG 182 and 183, three elective courses in an area of marketing must be completed.

This program is open to majors with an approved grade point average in electrical and computer engineering, mathematics, and physics courses. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bachelor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science in electrical engineering within a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree. Undergraduate students interested in the combined degree program are required to apply for the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the full undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master's degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 46 units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. However, completion of 10 or more units of coursework in electrical engineering taken for the master's degree satisfies the professional development requirement of the undergraduate program. The program of studies for the master's degree may include up to 20 units of electrical engineering upper-division elective coursework excluding ELEN 188 and 189. These undergraduate units can count toward a master's degree only if a grade of \"B\" or better is earned. Students who do not complete the combined degree program within six years of entering the University will automatically be transferred to the regular master's degree program. Although six years is the maximum timeframe for completing the combined degree, full-time students enrolling in February of their junior year normally complete both degrees within five years. Electrical and Computer Engineering Laboratories The RF and Communications Laboratory provides a full range of modern measurement capability up to 22 GHz, including a number of vector network analyzers, modern spectrum analyzers and antenna measurement set-ups.

The Military Science Program is designed to develop management skills and leadership abilities for successful careers in both the corporate world and the military. Students who complete the ROTC program are eligible for appointment and commissioning as officers in the United States Army. The military science core curriculum consists of six lower-division classes in the ROTC Basic Course and seven upper-division courses in the ROTC Advanced Course. Cadets may take a summer course (MILS 24) in lieu of the six lower-division courses. The professional military education of ROTC cadets consists of two components: a baccalaureate degree from Santa Clara University (or one of the cross-enrolled universities) and at least one undergraduate course from each of five designated fields of study. Prior to commissioning, cadets must take at least one course in military history. For those planning on commissioning into the U.S. Army, the curriculum is divided into ROTC Basic Course requirements and ROTC Advanced Course requirements. To proceed to the ROTC Advanced Course classes, students must complete either the six required ROTC Basic Course classes or attend a summer class at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The director of the Military Science Program must approve exceptions to this progression. ROTC Basic Course Requirements The ROTC Basic Course, Fundamentals of Leadership and Management, includes the first-year and second-year courses (MILS 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23) designed for beginning students who want to qualify for entry into the ROTC Advanced course and for those students who may want to try military science without obligations. A student can also qualify for entry in the ROTC Advanced Course by completing the summer training camp (MILS 24). ROTC Advanced Course Requirements The ROTC Advanced Course, Advanced Leadership and Management, consists of the third-year and fourth-year courses (MILS 131, 132, 133, 134, 141, 142, and 143) open to students who have completed or earned placement credit for the ROTC Basic Course. Students must complete all courses numbered greater than MILS 130, to include MILS 134, a six-week Cadet Leader Course during the summer, in sequence, unless otherwise approved by the professor of military science. The ROTC Advanced Course qualifies students for commissions as officers in the U.S. Army. Students who do not desire to compete for a commission as an officer in the Army may take these courses for academic credit with approval by the professor of military science. Leadership Laboratories Leadership laboratories, held weekly for three hours, are required of all students. Performance during lab periods is reflected in the student's course grade. Labs include activities such as terrain navigation, first aid training, virtual battle simulations, drill and ceremonies, and tactical leader development exercises. Laboratory and Field Exercises During each quarter of class work, weekly lab work is required. Two off-campus exercises involving adventure training, leadership training, and survival skills are optional for non-scholarship ROTC Basic Course students.

Study abroad during the fall, winter, and spring may be highly competitive and not all qualified applicants may be approved. Study abroad during the summer is not competitive. Students may study abroad during the summer following their first year, sophomore year, or junior year. Students studying abroad during the fall, winter, or spring may do so once during their junior or senior year. Many study abroad programs operate on a semester system with resulting units earned exceeding the usual maximum for courses completed on campus. Academic calendars abroad may differ significantly from the on-campus academic calendar at the University. Because the programs with which Santa Clara University areaffiliated vary in length, the Study Abroad Office evaluates each program to determine the appropriate maximum and minimum units for the term. Approved programs offer students opportunities to integrate with the host culture and foster personal reflection in the context of rigorous study. Programs may allow students to pursue independent research, attend classes with local students, participate in community-based learning, or gain professional experience through academic internships, which, in turn, can serve as a basis for senior capstone projects. During their first two years at Santa Clara, students build a foundation for the academic work they will pursue abroad. Students are encouraged to work with their academic advisor early to plan for study abroad, and to explore their goals with Study Abroad staff. The Study Abroad Office values diversity and inclusion and encourages students from all backgrounds to apply for study abroad. In addition, Santa Clara students are strongly encouraged to pursue opportunities in traditionally underrepresented geographic areas of the world. The goal is for student learning in the approved programs to build on and extend the on-campus curriculum. Students from underrepresented academic disciplines such as the sciences, engineering, and fine and performing arts are strongly urged to apply. Study abroad at Santa Clara University is a privilege, and the application process is competitive. The selection process is designed to offer study abroad opportunities to students who have thoughtfully selected programs that will significantly advance their academic, personal, and professional goals. Students are strongly encouraged to study abroad for a summer, quarter, or semester in a country and academic environment that will enrich their overall college experience and engender responsible participation in a global, multicultural society. Credit earned during study abroad counts toward graduation requirements either as elective credit or, with appropriate approval, may fulfill major, minor, and Core requirements. Grades are calculated into the Santa Clara University GPA, and all credit and grades appear on the Santa Clara University transcript. The University is committed to offering equal access to study abroad opportunities and therefore extends all available financial aid to students to support study abroad during the fall, winter, and spring. However, matriculated students who study abroad while withdrawn from the University are ineligible for financial aid and scholarships, and financial aid is not available for summer study abroad programs. The study abroad application process is a two-step process: (1) approval of the application by the Study Abroad Office; then (2) approval of a program-specific application by the study abroad program. In addition, participation is contingent upon satisfactory completion of all program prerequisites and related courses, satisfactory academic progress toward the student's major, and participation in study abroad mandatory pre-departure orientation and re-entry meetings. Normally, students apply for study abroad six months to one year prior to participation. During the selection process, the Study Abroad Office reviews applications with participation from faculty and staff from throughout the University. The Office reserves the right to redirect students to alternate programs due to institutional considerations. To apply for study abroad, students must be admitted to degree status at the University, have declared a major with the Office of the Registrar, and expect to have completed a minimum of 88 quarter units by the start of the academic program abroad. Normally, students participate in study abroad during their junior or senior year, but sophomores with extenuating academic circumstances may request an exception to the eligibility policy. Santa Clara requires a cumulative grade point average of 2.75 for off-campus study; requirements for individual programs may be more rigorous. Successful applicants will meet or exceed Santa Clara's requirements and that of their proposed program. Priority admission may be given to applicants for Santa Clara's own programs, including exchanges. Students must receive approval through the on-campus application process to receive credit for major, minor, or Core requirements completed through study abroad. Students on disciplinary probation or any form of suspension are not eligible to apply for or participate on any study abroad programs. Students who earn a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in any course in the term preceding their program may become ineligible for off-campus study. Students must clear any outstanding balances with the Bursar's Office in accordance with the Bursar's Office payment schedule to remain eligible for participation. The University does not approve study in countries or areas with a U.S. Department of State (DOS) Travel Advisory Level 3 or 4, see https://www.scu.edu/globalengagement/global-opportunities/health--safety/. Withdrawn students who study abroad independently may be eligible to receive a maximum of 10 units of elective credit toward graduation requirements, in keeping with the University's policy on transfer credit---the University's transfer credit policy does not allow credit earned while withdrawn from the University to count toward a student's major, minor, or Core requirements. Students should consult the policies governing units taken at other institutions in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations. For detailed information about individual programs, including eligibility requirements, contact the Study Abroad Office at studyabroad\\@scu.edu or 408-551-3019, or visit the website at www.scu.edu/globalengagement/study-abroad/. Students are urged to attend a Study Abroad 101 session to gain general information and contact SCU Study Abroad for advising in the Global Engagement Office, located on the first floor of Varsi Hall, for information about the competitive application process. Current approved study abroad programs are listed on the SCU Study Abroad website at www.scu.edu/globalengagement/study-abroad/. Note: Santa Clara University may be obliged to alter or eliminate programs at any time. Global Explorations The Study Abroad Office administers short-term, faculty-led programs through our Global Explorations Program. These programs are offered during the summer and typically run for three to four weeks abroad. Subjects vary from year to year based on the faculty teaching, consequently students should consult the website for current and future program offerings. "},"chapter-6/SummerSessions.html":{"url":"chapter-6/SummerSessions.html","title":"Summer Sessions","keywords":"","body":"Summer Sessions The Summer Sessions Office coordinates a comprehensive schedule of undergraduate courses in most of the academic departments from June through September. Summer Sessions invites students to reach their educational goals through the convenience of accelerated courses. Over 150 summer courses are held on campus and online. Sessions are three, five, and 10 weeks in length. Eight (8) units constitutes full-time status for undergraduate students enrolled in summer courses. Content, prerequisites, and units of summer courses are equivalent to fall, winter, and spring courses. Academic Regulations Most of the academic regulations that apply in the fall, winter, and spring quarters also apply to the summer terms. Courses taken during summer sessions are included in the records of matriculated Santa Clara University students for the determination of GPA, class level, honors, probation, and disqualification. Any student who is not permitted to register during fall, winter, or spring quarters (e.g. disqualified, suspension) may not enroll for summer courses at SCU. Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment The Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment policy is not in effect during the summer as it is during the fall, winter, and spring quarters. Students who are officially enrolled in a class and fail to attend the first and any subsequent class meetings will remain enrolled in the class and be responsible for paying all tuition and fees associated with the class. Students are responsible for dropping a course if they are unable to attend due to changes in the class schedule or personal obligations. Non-attendance does NOT relieve a student of the obligation to pay tuition and fees. In addition to paying full tuition and fees, an academic hold will be placed on the student's account to prevent any further registration transactions. Students who do not formally drop a class for which they are officially enrolled will receive an \"F\" grade for the course(s), and be liable for all tuition and fees incurred during the summer. Students must formally drop a course via eCampus or by submitting a Drop Form to the Enrollment Services Center prior to the published deadlines. Auditing Courses Non-SCU and non-degree seeking SCU students may not audit courses. Degree-seeking students may audit one course in addition to the summer sessions course load limit on a space available basis. Students will be charged a course audit fee. Permission to audit must be given by the instructor by the last day to add a class. Students should submit completed audit forms to the Enrollment Services Center by the last day to add a class. Course Load Limits Policy/Overload Policy There are NO EXCEPTIONS to the course load policy for summer sessions. Students who register for more than the maximum course load will be administratively withdrawn from the course that creates the overload. Students who add overload units in violation of this policy may not receive credit for the course that causes the policy violation. The intensive pace of Sessions 1, 2, and 3 require the following restrictions on summer course loads: Session 1 Students may not enroll in more than 10 units during this session Session 2 Students may not enroll in more than 10 units during this session Session 3 (A, B, and C): Students may not enroll in or attend more than one Session 3 lab science (chemistry or physics) course at a time If enrolled in or attending a Session 3 lab science course, students may not be simultaneously enrolled in or attending any Session 1, 2, or 4 course Course Cancellations Santa Clara University reserves the right to make changes in the schedules or policies without prior notice or obligation. If a course is canceled, the Summer Sessions Office will immediately send a notification to your @scu.edu address. Please check your SCU email daily. Enrollment and Course Restriction Policy Students may not sit in classes without formally enrolling. Credit is not given to students who attend class without formally enrolling and paying tuition. Students must be officially registered in classes based on the procedures outlined on the Summer Sessions website and must have paid all tuition and fees by the published deadlines. The instructor's signature on an add form after the add period does not constitute a formal enrollment without tuition payment.

"},"chapter-6/UniversityHonorsProgram.html":{"url":"chapter-6/UniversityHonorsProgram.html","title":"University Honors Program","keywords":"","body":"University Honors Program Director: Naomi J. Andrews The University Honors Program provides small, seminar-style classes that emphasize critical thinking, analytical rigor, effective expression, and interaction among professors and students. Honors classes inspire and enable intellectual risk-taking and lifelong learning and develop globally aware and engaged student leaders for the University community and beyond. The Honors educational experience culminates in a focused, meaningful, and collaborative thesis in senior year. Honors classes are designed to fit within the curricula of the humanities and natural and social sciences as well as business and engineering. Honors students can major in any undergraduate field offered at Santa Clara University. The University Honors Program welcomes students from diverse geographic, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. Students who enter the UHP at Level I (first-years) must complete a total of nine Honors-level courses plus a senior thesis. Students who enter the UHP at Level II (second-years) must complete a total of five Honors-level courses plus a thesis. Additional participation requirements and a cumulative 3.3 GPA are also required to maintain UHP status. Membership in the University Honors Program is a privilege; behavior that is inconsistent with the values and standards of the SCU community compromises your right to belong to UHP. Students in UHP are bound to the Student Conduct Code, and being found in violation of it through the Student Conduct System may result in removal from the program. Requirements for students who enter at Level I: Critical Thinking and Writing I Critical Thinking and Writing II Cultures and Ideas I Cultures and Ideas II HNRS 20 (Difficult Dialogues seminar course) Either a Core RTC I, 2, or 3 Honors or a Core Ethics Honors course Three UHP electives or experiences (see below) Senior Honors Thesis (one full academic year) Requirements for Students who enter at Level II: HNRS 20 (Difficult Dialogues seminar course) Four UHP electives or experiences (see below) Senior Honors Thesis (one full academic year) UHP Electives: Designated Honors courses Study abroad or summer study abroad (counts as one elective if over six weeks, 1/2 if under six weeks) Extra language course (counts as one elective) Contract Honors course (counts as one elective) Immersion trip through SCU Ignatian Center (counts as 1/2 elective, can be repeated once) UGST 101, Fellowships and Grad School Preparation (counts as 1/2 elective) Lower-Division Courses 1H. and 2H. Critical Thinking & Writing I and II A two-course, themed sequence for Honors students, featuring study and practice of academic discourse, with emphasis on critical reading and writing, composing processes, and rhetorical situation (ENGL 1H and 2H, PHIL 1H and 2H, etc.). The second course will feature more advanced study and practice of academic discourse, with additional emphasis on information literacy and skills related to developing and organizing longer and more complex documents. Themes may address cultural comparisons, science and society, and other topics. (4 units each quarter) 11H and 12H. Cultures & Ideas I and II A two-course sequence focusing on a major theme in human experience and culture over a significant period of time (e.g., ARTH 11H and 12H, HIST 11H and 12H, PHIL 11H and 12H). Four Honors sequences will be offered each year. Courses emphasize either broad global interconnections or the construction of Western culture in its global context. Successful completion of C&I I is a prerequisite for C&I II. (4 units each quarter) HNRS 20. Difficult Dialogues This seminar-style course is devoted to the analysis from different perspectives of some issue, text, or problem in the area of a professor's expertise. This course will provide critical thinking skills and an opportunity for students to discuss and debate the toughest questions faced by society today. Honors 20 is required of all Honors students and is open only to Honors students. (4 units) Upper-Division Courses UGST 101. Fellowship and Grad School Preparation Seminar for students interested in preparing for a major fellowship competition (e.g., Fulbright, Rhodes, Knight-Hennessey, Schwarzman, Marshall, Mitchell, Truman, Goldwater, Udall, Gaither, NSF), internal SCU grants and programs, and preparation for application to graduate or medical school. Open to all students. (2 units, taught in winter quarter only) 195. Honors Program Thesis Course credit for thesis or culminating project of the University Honors Program. Enrollment limited to students in the University Honors Program. This course is Pass/No Pass. There are no lectures for this course---thesis milestones turned in through Camino. Interim grades of \"N\" will be given until thesis is successfully submitted. (1 unit) Contract Courses With the agreement of the instructor, an Honors student may get Honors credit for a non-Honors course by adding an enrichment activity or project. The student and the faculty member agree on this added requirement. The goal of the added contract is the student's acquisition of a deeper and richer command of some aspect of the course material. The student may be afforded an opportunity to present the results of the research to the class. Honors Contract courses may be especially valuable in the student's junior year as a precursor to the senior thesis. Students wishing to establish a contract for Honors credit must turn in the appropriate application to the office by the end of the first week of the quarter in which the course is taken. "},"chapter-7/AdmissionofUndergraduateStudents.html":{"url":"chapter-7/AdmissionofUndergraduateStudents.html","title":"Chapter 7: Admission of Undergraduate Students","keywords":"","body":"Admission of Undergraduate Students Santa Clara University is a selective admission university that admits new students based on past performance, potential for future academic success, and contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Applicants are admitted as full-time, degree-seeking students. Santa Clara does not have a part-time undergraduate program option and does not enroll non-degree students except international non-degree students participating in an approved international partnership. Non-degree international student programs are administered by Study Abroad in the Global Engagement area. See the limited conditions outlined in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations. Entering first-year and transfer students are admitted for fall and winter terms. Students are admitted for spring term only by special exception with the approval of the dean of admission. Entering first-year students are admitted to the University and to a specific school and in some cases major based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schools may apply for a transfer only at the end of their first year of attendance. Admission of Entering First-Year Students Admission of applicants to Santa Clara University as entering first-year students is based on their academic record in high school including course rigor, results on standardized tests when submitted, and other criteria outlined below. While Santa Clara University does not have a specific high school grade point average or standardized test score requirement, potential for successful academic performance in the rigorous undergraduate program at Santa Clara is correlated with high academic performance in high school. Santa Clara also bases admission on demonstrated potential for contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University, but only after assessment of academic performance and potential. Applications for admission as an entering first-year student are evaluated using the following criteria: Overall quality of high school courses and appropriately challenging coursework Academic performance in high school, including the cumulative grade point average from the first year of high school through the junior year of high school (grades from the first term of the senior year may also be included) Results of standardized SAT or ACT tests (optional) One teacher evaluation from an 11th or 12th grade core academic class Involvement in school and community activities The basic subject recommendations for admission as an entering first-year students includes: History and Social Science: 3 years English: 4 years Mathematics: 3 years required; 4 years recommended Laboratory Science: 2 years required; 3 years recommended Language other than English: 2 years required; 3 years recommended; 4 years preferred Visual and Performing Arts: 1 year recommended College Preparatory Electives: 1 year Admission to first-year student standing at Santa Clara depends on a continued high level of performance during the remainder of the applicant's senior year in the curriculum provided on the application and upon receipt of a high school diploma. If a significant change occurs in the applicant's academic performance during the senior year, his or her admission status may be reevaluated by the University. Early Decision I Track Applicants to the Early Decision I Track must submit complete applications by November 1 of their senior year. Early Decision applicants are notified of the final admission decision by the end of December. Santa Clara's Early Decision I Track is a binding program that requires commitment and confirmation of intent to enroll by those admitted under this program. Financial aid awards will be sent to admitted students who meet deadlines for filing required forms. Deposits must be received by January 7. After admission, all applications for admission to other colleges or universities must be withdrawn. Some Early Decision I applicants who are competitive but not clearly admissible will be deferred and evaluated with other applicants under the Regular Decision Track. Students denied under the Early Decision I Track may not reapply under the Regular Decision Track for the same academic year. Applicants with alumni ties will receive the most consideration for their affiliation with the University during the Early Decision I process. Early Action Track Applicants to the Early Action Track must submit their applications by November 1 of their senior year. Early Action applicants are notified of the admissions decision by the end of December. Santa Clara's Early Action Track is nonbinding; consequently, students admitted under the Early Action Track are not required to withdraw other college applications and have until May 1 to confirm enrollment at Santa Clara. Some Early Action applicants who are competitive but not clearly admissible will be deferred and evaluated with other applicants under the Regular Decision Track. Students denied under the Early Action Track may not reapply under the Regular Decision Track for the same academic year. Early Decision II Track Applicants to the Early Decision II Track must submit complete applications by January 7 of their senior year. Early Decision II applicants are notified of the final admission decision by mid-February. Santa Clara's Early Decision II Track is a binding program that requires commitment and confirmation of intent to enroll by those admitted under this program. Financial aid awards will be sent to admitted students who meet deadlines for filing required forms. Deposits must be received by March 1.

Admission of applicants to Santa Clara University as entering transfer students is based on their academic record at other colleges or universities in conjunction with evaluation of an official high school transcript and other criteria outlined below. While Santa Clara University does not have a specific grade point requirement, potential for successful academic performance in the rigorous undergraduate program at Santa Clara is highly correlated with prior academic performance in challenging courses. Santa Clara also bases admission on demonstrated potential for contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Transfer applicants for fall term are notified of the admissions decision on a rolling basis until enrollment capacity has been reached. Applicants for admission to Santa Clara University as entering transfer students must have completed at least 8 semester or 12 quarter transferable units at an accredited college or university. Applicants with fewer than 8 semester or 12 quarter transferable units at the time of application should follow the application procedure for entering first-year students. Note that if a transfer applicant has not already completed 30 semester or 45 quarter transferable units when the application is submitted, he or she will be required to submit an official SAT or ACT score report. The entire academic history of the applicant is considered in the admission review. Course selection and consistency of performance by the applicant are also considered. Applicants on academic or disciplinary probation or suspension at another institution are not considered for admission. Recommended Courses for Transfer Students Applicants for admission to Santa Clara University as entering transfer students enhance their chances for admission by completing as many courses that fulfill the Santa Clara Core Curriculum requirements as possible before transferring. Preference will be given to students who have completed the following courses: College of Arts and Sciences English Composition (2 semesters or 2 quarters) College-level Mathematics: 2 semesters or 2 quarters for bachelor of science 1 semester or 1 quarter for bachelor of arts Natural Science with a Lab (1 semester or 1 quarter) Leavey School of Business English Composition (2 semesters or 2 quarters) Calculus and Analytic Geometry (2 semesters or 2 quarters) Accounting (2 semesters or 3 quarters) Microeconomics and Macroeconomics (1 semester or 1 quarter each) School of Engineering English Composition (2 semesters or 2 quarters) Calculus and Analytic Geometry (2 semesters or 3 quarters) Chemistry (1 semester or 1 quarter) Physics (2 semesters or 3 quarters) Transfer Credit Entering transfer students generally receive credit after admission for courses from other colleges and universities that are similar to courses offered at Santa Clara University. Courses from accredited institutions are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer. Transfer credit is awarded only for courses in which the student earned a grade of \"C\" or better. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not eligible for transfer* (see Note below for Spring 2020 term exceptions). Students may transfer a maximum of 58.33 semester or 87.5 quarter units to the College of Arts and Sciences or the Leavey School of Business. The School of Engineering will grant credit for up to one-half of the degree requirements toward the major.

Requirements for academic majors can be found under the departmental listings in the chapters for each respective college or school. Students must declare their primary academic major by the end of the sophomore year. Students may declare a major at the time of initial matriculation, except in the Leavey School of Business where declaration of a major is normally made during sophomore year. Students who initially matriculate without a declared major must obtain the approval of the department chair of the intended major and submit a Program Petition form to the Enrollment Services Center. Students participating in study abroad or domestic public sector study programs must declare a major before participating in the program. Students may declare a second academic major in addition to their primary major; however, students in the Leavey School of Business may only declare a second major in the College of Arts and Sciences or the School of Engineering. Students who want to declare a second major must obtain the approval of the department chair of the intended major and the college/school for the second major if different from the student's primary major and submit a Program Petition form to the Enrollment Services Center. To be awarded a second major, a student must complete all requirements of the Core Curriculum, college or school, and departmental requirements for that major. Requirements for a second major are as binding as those of a primary major and must be completed before a degree will be awarded. If a student decides to drop a second major, he or she must submit a Program Petition form to the Enrollment Services Center. Academic Minors Students may declare an academic minor from among the departmental minors offered through the college or schools, the general minor in engineering, or one of the interdisciplinary minors offered by the University. Requirements for the academic minors can be found in the chapters of the respective college or school in this Bulletin. Students who want to declare an academic minor must obtain the approval of the department chair or program director of the intended minor and submit a Program Petition form to the Enrollment Services Center. Some minors may require an application process and are limited based on space available. To be awarded a minor, a student must complete all requirements of the minor as prescribed. Requirements for a minor are binding and must be completed before a degree will be awarded. If a student decides to drop a minor, he or she must submit a Program Petition form to the Enrollment Services Center. Second Bachelor's Degree A student may earn a second bachelor's degree at Santa Clara University, but may not duplicate a degree (i.e., bachelor of arts, bachelor of science in a natural science, bachelor of science in a social science, bachelor of science in commerce, bachelor of science in engineering). Students whose first degree is from Santa Clara and who are interested in pursuing a second bachelor's degree concurrently or without interruption must have an academic record showing a strong probability of success and a proposed program of study for the second degree that fulfills the degree requirements in effect at their original date of matriculation. At least half of the units for the second degree must be in addition to those required for the first degree and must be completed through a Santa Clara program. Approval to pursue a second bachelor's degree must be granted by the Dean of Academic Support Services and filed with the Office of the Registrar. If a student is returning to the University after an absence, they must meet the criteria outlined above, but is subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of re-entry. Approval from the Dean of Academic Support Services is required to resume studies for a second degree after an absence. Students whose first degree is from an institution other than Santa Clara must submit a formal application for admission to the Office of Undergraduate Admission. The application must specify that the second degree will not duplicate any other degree. Students admitted for a second bachelor's degree are subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of admission. At least half the units required for the second bachelor's degree must be earned through a Santa Clara program. Graduation with Honors Candidates for a bachelor's degree with a grade point average between 3.500 and 3.699 graduate cum laude (with honors); candidates with a grade point average between 3.700 and 3.899 graduate magna cum laude (with high honors); and candidates with a grade point average of 3.900 or higher graduate summa cum laude (with highest honors). For the purposes of calculating Latin honors, grade point averages are not rounded. Awarding of honors is based on all graded undergraduate courses attempted at Santa Clara University that are counted toward the fulfillment of a student's degree. Honors will not be awarded above those merited by the student's record at Santa Clara. An indication of honors at graduation contained in the commencement program is unofficial. The final determination will be made after a review of all completed undergraduate courses counted toward the degree. Participation in Commencement To participate in commencement, candidates for a bachelor's degree must have completed all degree requirements (or must have 10 or fewer units to complete) and a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 as well as a minimum 2.0 GPA in all courses in their academic major(s) and academic minor(s). Candidates must clearly demonstrate that all coursework will be completed by either summer or fall immediately following June Commencement and must have completed and submitted a Candidacy Petition for the Bachelor's Degree form to the Office of the Registrar. (New policy proposal pending review by Academic Senate) "},"chapter-8/AcademicProgramPoliciesandRegulations.html":{"url":"chapter-8/AcademicProgramPoliciesandRegulations.html","title":"Academic Program Policies and Regulations","keywords":"","body":"Academic Program Policies and Regulations Course Numbering and Course Credits Lower-division courses are numbered 1 through 99, and upper-division courses are numbered 100 through 199. In the College of Arts and Sciences and the Leavey School of Business, most lower-division courses carry 4 units of academic credit and most upper-division courses carry 5 units of academic credit. In the School of Engineering, unit values for courses vary according to the number of hours in class per week. Credit Unit Policy Academic work at Santa Clara University is measured by credit unit. A unit of credit represents that amount of time and effort both within and outside of formal settings that a student devotes to a particular class. At the undergraduate level, one unit of credit represents approximately three hours of work per week per term by the student, including time engaged in class and time committed to class preparation, studying, and assigned projects. A unit of credit for laboratory courses, independent study, internships, practica, and study abroad is awarded on the same basis as for a lecture course: One unit of credit represents approximately three hours of work per week per term by the student. At the graduate level, course credit is determined by the college or school and is consistent with practices in the disciplines. Change of Academic Major A change of major within the same school or college requires the approval of the relevant department chair or program director. Students wishing to change their academic major within a school must submit a Program Petition form to the Enrollment Services Center. Change of School Entering first-year students are admitted to the University and to a specific school based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schools within the University may not apply for such a change until the end of their first year of attendance. Changes between schools may be limited by the availability of space within the school and the specific academic major. Students wishing to change schools must meet the admittance criteria of the school and complete the application process specified by that school. Upon acceptance by the school, the student must submit a completed Program Petition form to the Enrollment Services Center. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than \"C-.\" In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the calculation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and performance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion. Students should consult the chair of the department in which the course is offered to confirm that a given course may be repeated for credit. Independent Study Students may pursue independent study through directed reading, directed research, internships, practica, or cooperative education. To qualify, a student must have demonstrated a sufficient knowledge of the academic discipline involved to make independent study both possible and beneficial. No more than 20 units of independent study may be used to satisfy graduation requirements, and no more than 5 units of independent study may be taken per term. Students must enroll for the term in which the independent study occurs. Directed reading and directed research are limited to upper-division students who undertake a research project or other well-defined study beyond the scope of a regular course under the supervision of a faculty member. Such work should be comparable to that required for courses of equivalent unit value. Students can obtain practical learning experience through internships, cooperative education, and practica. Internships and cooperative education are approved work experiences in a non-classroom environment in industry, government, or other setting, generally available only to upper-division students. Students who enroll in an internship or cooperative education experience for academic credit must fulfill specified academic requirements in addition to the responsibilities expected by the organization hosting the internship or cooperative education experience. Practica provide practical experience in a discipline-specific field experience or an approved University program activity, such as participation on the school newspaper staff. Practica are generally available only to upper-division students, but some practicum experiences are available to lower-division students who meet specified eligibility criteria. Students wishing to enroll in an independent study course must initiate the request for independent study with the appropriate faculty member, or with the Career Center for cooperative education experiences. The appropriate form, with the required materials and other approvals, must be submitted to the Drahmann Center for final approval prior to registering for the course. Challenging Courses In rare circumstances, students may petition to challenge a course by examination in order to fulfill a course prerequisite or degree requirement. Since most courses at Santa Clara University require laboratory, studio, discussion, and/or group work, which cannot be evaluated by examination, approval to challenge courses will be unusual. Departments have full discretion to determine which of their courses, if any, may be challenged. To challenge a course, a student must demonstrate mastery of the course content and learning objectives, as well as any additional requirements specified by the department that offers the course being challenged. A successful challenge neither earns units toward graduation nor contributes to the fulfillment of residency requirements. In order to be eligible to challenge a course, a student must have completed at least one term at Santa Clara, have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, and receive permission of the course instructor and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. Only currently enrolled students are eligible to challenge a course. Students may not attempt to challenge a particular course more than once. Students wishing to challenge a course must complete a Course Challenge Petition (available from the Office of the Registrar), which provides evidence of circumstances justifying the challenge, and submit the form to the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If approved, the department chair arranges the examination after the student files the Course Challenge Petition with the Office of the Registrar and pays the applicable fee. The examination will be administered and evaluated by the department that offers the course. If successful, the department chair will notify the Registrar that the requirement has been fulfilled. Undergraduate Class Attendance Policy Students are responsible for completing all course requirements as set forth by the instructor. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absences from class are left to the discretion of individual instructors subject to restrictions imposed by law, including, but not limited to, policies associated with the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act (ADAAA) and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) (see below). The instructor's policies will be communicated clearly in writing. Students are accountable for all course assignments, whether or not the assignments were announced during an absence, and for meeting assigned deadlines, even when the deadline falls on the day a student is absent from class. For details on grading, see the Grading Policies and Regulations section in this chapter. In certain situations involving unavoidable absence, students may be offered the opportunity to make up a missed assignment/activity or to complete an alternative assignment, unless the design of the course offers no opportunity for in-class work to be made up. These include both foreseen and unforeseen documented and verified situations such as: Serious personal illness Death of immediate family member Participation in significant religious observances Participation in events or activities as official representatives of Santa Clara University In cases of unforeseen, unavoidable absence, students should contact the instructor as soon as possible. Under certain circumstances, the Cowell Center or the Office of Student Life may contact the instructor on behalf of the student. In cases of foreseen absence due to significant religious observances or official representation of the University in events, students should discuss the conflict with the instructor well in advance of the absence in order to determine possible alternate arrangements. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absence are left to the discretion of individual instructors. Instructors may require documentation from the appropriate University personnel regarding the reason for the intended absence. Title IX: Pregnant and Parenting Students Santa Clara University is committed to maintaining an equitable learning environment and supporting the academic success of pregnant and parenting students. The University prohibits discrimination based on parental status, pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery from related conditions in all of its educational programs and activities pursuant to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Students may request an accommodation for pregnancy-related conditions or parenting responsibilities by contacting the University's Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX Coordinator, Loyola Hall, Suite 140, 425 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95050, bguthrie@scu.edu, (408) 554-3043, www.scu.edu/title-ix/. Final Examinations A final examination, if given in a course, must be given on the date and time scheduled by the Office of the Registrar. If the final examination is a take-home examination, it may not be due before the scheduled final examination time or any later than the last day of the examination period. Similarly, other end-of-quarter assignments (papers, projects, for example) may not be due any later than the last day of the examination period. Exceptions to this policy require approval of the department chair and the relevant academic dean.

During the first week of each fall, winter, and spring term, students may add and drop classes in accordance with the procedures established by the Office of the Registrar. During the first, second, third, and fourth weeks of the term, a student may drop a class without receiving a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. From the fifth week to the end of the seventh week of the term, a student may drop a class and receive a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. Students may not drop classes after the last day of the seventh week of the term. Students who do not complete a course and do not drop the class in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in the class. Students who have not earned 44 units, including transfer and test credit, may be subject to administrative withdrawal from upper-division courses. This restriction does not apply to upper-division courses for which a student has demonstrated sufficient proficiency. Students may not sit in a class without formally enrolling in the class. Sitting in a class or obtaining an instructor's signature on an add form does not constitute enrollment. Students who do not attend the first day of a class are subject to administrative cancellation of their enrollment in that class in order to make space available to other students. A student who must miss the first day of a class and wishes to remain in the course should contact the instructor in advance. No student who misses the first day of a class should assume that they have been dropped from the course. Students are responsible for checking the status of their enrollment in all courses prior to the end of the late registration period. Unit Overload Students may enroll for no more than 19 units unless they are in the University Honors Program, their cumulative grade point average at Santa Clara is at least 3.3, or they have upper-division status and obtain approval from the Drahmann Center. One 2-unit course or two 1-unit courses are not counted as overload units. Students who meet the criteria above will not be permitted to register for more than 25 units without approval of the Dean of Academic Support Services. Students may register for courses that result in overload units only during the late registration period. See the website of the Office of the Registrar for registration schedules. Auditing Courses Students admitted to degree status at Santa Clara may audit one course in addition to their regular course load in a term. A maximum of three courses may be audited during a student's academic career. Permission to audit a course will be given only at the end of the late registration period and only if space is available in the class. No credit is assigned for an audited course, but the successful completion of an audit will be indicated on a student's transcript by the notation \"AUD.\" Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to administrative cancellation of their enrollment in that course. Prior to the end of the late registration period, an instructor may notify the University registrar to drop first-year students who registered in upper-division courses, to drop students who have not satisfied the prerequisites for the course, or to drop students lacking the instructor permission required for certain courses. Withdrawal from the University Students who wish to withdraw from the University must do so by the last day of classes, and must complete a withdrawal survey, appropriate forms, and an exit interview in the Drahmann Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's registration will be canceled without further academic penalty. Students who leave the University during a quarter without withdrawing in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in all courses in which they were registered and are not eligible for a refund of tuition or other fees. Students who withdraw from the University are responsible for any outstanding financial obligations with the University. Students who used deferred payment plans or student loans during their attendance at the University must clear their financial obligations with the Financial Aid Office and the Bursar's Office. Students who have unpaid bills or other unsettled financial obligations with the University will not be eligible for re-enrollment until they have cleared all such obligations. Withdrawal for Health Reasons Students may experience an illness, injury, or psychological condition that significantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely in their role as students. In these instances, the Policy for Withdrawal for Health Reasons allows time away from the University for treatment and recovery until functioning is restored to a level that will enable the student to return to the University. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the procedures for student withdrawals from the University for reasons of health and/or safety. The University has designated four categories relating to withdrawal. They differ according to who initiates the action, whether it is voluntary or not, and the re-enrollment procedures. The vice provost for student life or designee, in consultation with the appropriate mental and medical health professionals and other staff as deemed necessary, is responsible for the implementation of this policy as stated in the Student Handbook. Re-enrollment at the University A student who withdrew from the University is eligible to re-enroll without special permission under the following conditions: The student left the University in good academic standing The student has no outstanding financial obligations with the University The student plans to return to the same college or school at the University The student is returning within five years of the date of their withdrawal Students who do not meet the conditions above must seek permission to re-enroll from the Dean of Academic Support Services. Re-enrolling students are subject to degree and curriculum requirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entry. Students wishing to re-enroll must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing of their intent to return using the Returning Student form and should consult with a University advisor in the Drahmann Center to review their academic plans. Students on leave who have attended another college or university are permitted to transfer in only a maximum of 10 units of elective credit and are required to forward to the Office of the Registrar an official transcript of all work completed during their absence. "},"chapter-8/GradingPoliciesandRegulations.html":{"url":"chapter-8/GradingPoliciesandRegulations.html","title":"Grading Policies and Regulations","keywords":"","body":"Grading Policies and Regulations Grading Grades are assigned by the instructor to reflect the quality of a student's work. The University uses the following grades: A: Excellent B: Good C: Adequate D: Barely Passing F: Not Passing P: Pass NP: No Pass The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes, except that the grade of \"A\" may not be modified by a (+) suffix. Grade point values per unit are assigned as follows: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7 B+ = 3.3 B = 3.0 B- = 2.7 C+ = 2.3 C = 2.0 C‚àí = 1.7 D+ = 1.3 D = 1.0 D‚àí = 0.7 F = 0 Unit credit, but not grade point credit, is awarded when the grade of \"P\" is assigned. Unit credit is not awarded when the grade of \"NP\" is assigned. The University also uses the following marks for which no unit credit or grade point value is granted: I: Incomplete N: Continuing work NS: No Show AUD: Audit W: Withdrawn Pass/No Pass (P/NP) A grade of \"P\" signifies that the quality of work done is equivalent to a letter grade of \"C\" or higher, while a grade of \"NP\" denotes work at the level of \"C-\" or lower. A maximum of six courses taken under the pass/no pass option in which the student receives a mark of \"P\" can be used to fulfill the unit requirements for graduation. Some courses are offered only on a pass/no pass basis. If a graded option is not available, a course can satisfy Core, major, and/or minor requirements. A student with junior or senior standing and a declared major may choose to take an elective course on a pass/no pass basis. Students may enroll in only one elective course on a pass/no pass basis per quarter. Students may choose the pass/no pass option for a class through the end of the fourth week of classes, but may not change the grading option after that date. Incomplete (I) The mark of \"I\" (incomplete) may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the course instructor within three weeks of the beginning of classes in the next scheduled term (not the student's next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, unless extraordinary circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University Registrar within the original three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quarters after the mark of \"I\" was assigned, excluding summer session. An incomplete that has not been completed within the specified deadline or has not received an approved extension will be converted to a grade of \"F.\" Continuing Work (N) The mark of \"N\" (continuing work) may be assigned by an instructor when course requirements span more than one term. When the course requirements are completed, the instructor assigns a standard grade. A student may not graduate and receive a degree with a mark of \"N\" on their academic record. No Show (NS) The mark of \"NS\" (no show) may be assigned by an instructor when a student never attends a class and does not drop the class. A mark of \"NS\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark after it is assigned by the instructor. A mark of \"NS\" is included in the student's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mark of \"NS\" in a class. Audit (AUD) The mark of \"AUD\" is assigned when a student enrolls in a class on an audit basis. A mark of \"AUD\" cannot be changed to any other grade. Withdrawn (W) The mark of \"W\" is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements for dropping a class or withdrawing from the University. A mark of \"W\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark. A mark of \"W\" is included in the student's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. Grade Point Average A student's grade point average is determined by multiplying each grade point value by the number of quarter units assigned to the course, adding these grade point units from all courses taken, and dividing this sum by the total number of quarter units for which letter grades were reported. Grade reports are posted at the end of each quarter and indicate both the grade point average earned by the student during the quarter and the cumulative grade point average earned by the student for all courses completed to that point. Grades earned in courses in SCU-operated or SCU-affiliated study abroad or domestic study programs are included in the calculation of a student's grade point average. Grades earned in courses at other institutions accepted for transfer credit are not included in the calculation of a student's grade point average. Evaluation of Progress Grades are available at the end of the term via University eCampus. Faculty members are expected to apprise students of their course progress at reasonable intervals. Some measurements of progress should take place in time to enable students to make reasonable decisions with respect to the fourth-week and seventh-week withdrawal deadlines. Change of Grade Only the faculty member responsible for a course may assign grades. All grades become final when they have been assigned and reported to the Office of the Registrar. A faculty member may report a correction of a final grade to the Office of the Registrar only if a clerical or procedural error was made in assigning, transmitting, or recording the original grade. A grade may not be changed as a result of re-evaluation, re-examination, or the submission of additional work after the term ends. Any grade change must have the approval of the department chair and the associate dean of the student's school or college. No grade may be changed after one year. Student Appeals of Grades Grades are not negotiable. There should be no questioning of a faculty member's academic judgment on a grade. In registering for a class, students implicitly agree to allow the faculty member to make a qualitative judgment of their command of the subject matter, which will be expressed as a letter grade. Any questioning or appeal of a grade should therefore be limited to procedure, e.g., to computational errors or failures to follow grading policies set forth in the syllabi. Any system of grade-appeal should protect the rights of faculty members as well as the rights of students. The results of any system of grade-appeal should not be binding upon the faculty member. Any decision to initiate a change of grade should remain the faculty member's. Any procedural complaint regarding a change of grade must be initiated within four weeks of the beginning of the next scheduled term, not including summer sessions. A student with a complaint must first discuss the matter with the faculty member. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student may then take the matter to the chairperson of the department involved. The chairperson will discuss the case with the faculty member and may recommend that the faculty member review the grade. Upon the request of the student, the dean will proceed in similar fashion. Should the student request it, the dean will pass the matter on to the provost. This process of review gives the chairperson, dean, and provost the right to discuss the matter with the faculty member, and if they think it appropriate, request that the faculty member review the grade. Any recommendations made will not be binding upon the faculty member against whom the complaint is lodged. The decision to change a grade remains with the faculty member. "},"chapter-8/AcademicStandingandStudentClassification.html":{"url":"chapter-8/AcademicStandingandStudentClassification.html","title":"Academic Standing and Student Classification","keywords":"","body":"Academic Standing and Student Classification Student Classification The University only admits students to its undergraduate degree programs on a full-time basis. Students who have not been admitted to degree status at the University may register for classes in accordance with the policies and regulations outlined in the section of this chapter covering non-degree students. The classification of students is determined by the number of quarter units completed with passing grades. Lower-division students are considered first-year if they have completed fewer than 44 units and sophomores when they have completed at least 44 units but fewer than 88 units. Upper-division students are considered juniors when they have completed at least 88 units but fewer than 131 units and seniors when they have completed at least 131 units. If a student is enrolled for 12 or more units in a given term, they have full-time status for academic purposes. Students enrolled for fewer than 12 units have part-time status for that term and may not qualify for all University activities and benefits, such as eligibility for financial aid, on-campus housing, and intercollegiate athletic competition. Continuing enrollment at the University in part-time status requires approval by the Dean of Academic Support Services. Academic Standing To be in good academic standing at the University, a student must normally be enrolled for 12 or more units, must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara, and must have completed at least a minimum number of units as specified below. Failure to meet these requirements may result in academic probation or disqualification from future registration at the University. Students in their last term of enrollment before completing a degree may be classified for academic standing purposes as a full-time student when enrolled for less than 12 units. Academic Probation Students at Santa Clara are subject to academic probation if their cumulative grade point average is lower than 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara. Students are also subject to academic probation if they fail to make satisfactory progress toward their degree as defined below: Completing at least 36 quarter units in the previous three quarters of residency or Completing at least 36 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing at least 76 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing at least 115 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing at least 160 quarter units by the end of the 12th quarter of residency Academic Disqualification Students are subject to disqualification from further registration at the University for any of the following reasons: Remaining on academic probation for more than two quarters without improvement Failing to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 or Completing fewer than 30 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing fewer than 64 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 100 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 150 quarter units by the end of the 12th quarter of residency Reinstatement to the University Reinstatement to the University after disqualification is rarely permitted and requires favorable action by the Dean of Academic Support Services in consultation with the dean of the student's college or school. Requests for reinstatement are made to the Dean of Academic Support Services and must include a description of any activities during the period of disqualification that would indicate that an improved academic performance can be expected in the future. A student generally may not apply for reinstatement within a year of the date of disqualification. The request for reinstatement will be considered only if the student's academic deficiencies can be corrected within a reasonable time. "},"chapter-8/AcademicCreditEvaluation.html":{"url":"chapter-8/AcademicCreditEvaluation.html","title":"Academic Credit Evaluation","keywords":"","body":"Academic Credit Evaluation Santa Clara awards credit based on the Advanced Placement Program, the International Baccalaureate Program, University of Cambridge International Examinations, courses completed at other accredited colleges and universities, and courses completed in University-approved study abroad and domestic study programs using the criteria outlined herein. Students are allowed to transfer in a maximum of one-half of the total quarter units required to graduate in their specific program. Students may not take a SCU course for credit for which they have already received transfer credit. Santa Clara University does not allow students to receive duplicate credit for courses. You can either receive test credit for a course or take the course at SCU, but not both. Credit is not awarded for the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). Advanced Placement (AP) Credit Santa Clara participates in the Advanced Placement Program to recognize college-level academic achievement prior to matriculation and to encourage students to pursue advanced studies in their areas of interest. Credit or placement is determined by the appropriate department based on review of the student's Advanced Placement scores, sometimes in the context of supplemental departmental examinations. Note: students who are awarded credit for exams taken in Spring 2020 that covered a shortened curriculum and who wish to enroll in the next level course at Santa Clara University should consult with their department and/or advisor to ensure they will not be at a disadvantage in that field of study. The following chart indicates the subject examination, required scores, and Santa Clara credit granted through the Advanced Placement tests. Courses waived will always satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum. Courses waived by AP test scores, when relevant, may satisfy Second Language, Mathematics, Natural Science, and Social Science requirements in the Core Curriculum. No other undergraduate Core requirement can be satisfied with AP test scores.

University of Cambridge International Examinations Santa Clara University accepts selected University of Cambridge International Advanced (A) Level examinations with letter grades of A (a) or B (b). Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Ordinary (O) Level examinations are not awarded credit. Final decisions on academic credit for A Level subject examinations are made individually by the appropriate academic department in consultation with the University Registrar. Courses waived will satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum. Transfer Credit and the Core Curriculum All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; Religion, Theology & Culture; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for Social Justice; and Pathways. For all other Core requirements, it is possible for students to earn credit by taking Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, or by completing college-level courses prior to enrolling at Santa Clara. Transfer credit earned from courses completed before enrollment at Santa Clara is governed by two sets of rules: One for students admitted as first-year students and another for transfer students. Students admitted as first-year students must satisfy Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2, and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3 with courses completed at Santa Clara University. In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 before their first quarter at Santa Clara. Transfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in the required sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any AP or IB test credit, must complete two courses from the Religion, Theology & Culture sequence in any order. Transfer students must declare their Pathways by the end of their third quarter at SCU. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units must take four courses (minimum of 16 units) to fulfill the Pathways requirement. Transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) to fulfill the Pathways requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must take three courses (minimum of 12 units) to fulfill the Pathways requirement. More detailed Pathway guidelines are available on the Pathways website. Transfer credit earned from courses completed after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill Core Curriculum or other requirements. A maximum number of 10 quarter units of free elective transfer credit can be awarded. Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the chapter(s) relevant to their school or college for additional relevant information. Units Taken at Other Institutions Credit is awarded for coursework completed at other accredited colleges and universities subject to certain limitations. Courses are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses of a trade or technical nature do not transfer. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer. Transfer students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities prior to matriculation at Santa Clara for no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for the specific Santa Clara degree. After enrolling at Santa Clara, students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities for no more than 10 quarter units of free electives, subject to the limitation that no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for a Santa Clara degree can be earned at another institution. Transfer credit earned after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill undergraduate Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or program requirements. Transfer credit for all coursework completed at other colleges and universities requires approval from the Office of the Registrar and the chair of the department offering the equivalent Santa Clara course. The student must have earned a grade of \"C\" or better in a course for transfer credit to be granted. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not accepted as transfer credit (Note below, the exception being made to Spring 2020 term course work). Grades for units earned at other institutions are not included in a student's Santa Clara academic history or in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. (Note: Exception for Spring 2020 term: Regarding transfer credits for work completed in Spring Term 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, course work receiving a grade of Pass or Credit is transferable. We encourage students continuing on in those subject areas to consult with their departments and advisors to ensure they are adequately prepared for the next level courses.) Study Abroad and Domestic Study Programs Qualified undergraduate students may apply to study abroad for a quarter, semester, or summer term in a country and academic environment that will enrich their overall college experience, contribute positively to the life of the University, and engender responsible participation in a global, multicultural society. Units and grades earned through study abroad programs and domestic off-campus study programs that have been approved through regular University processes are included on the Santa Clara University transcript and may be used to fulfill major, minor, and Core requirements with prior approval by the department chair or Core director. Grades earned in approved study abroad and domestic off-campus study programs are included in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. The third-level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology & Culture cannot be fulfilled with a study abroad course. Units earned for coursework in study abroad and domestic off-campus study programs not approved by the University through the regular application process are subject to the policies governing transfer credit and may not fulfill major, minor, or Core requirements. See the sections on transfer credit earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 7.

Academic dishonesty may include but is not limited to plagiarism (i.e., representing the work or ideas of others as one's own without giving proper acknowledgment), cheating (e.g., copying the work of another person, falsifying laboratory data, sabotaging the work of others), and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context. A student who is guilty of a dishonest act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to and including dismissal from the University, as a result of the student judicial process as described in the Student Handbook and the Academic Integrity Protocol. A student who violates copyright laws, including those covering the copying of software programs, or who knowingly alters official academic records from this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action. Academic Integrity Protocol Allegations within the Context of a Course These procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University community with a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind as described in the Student Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, or the use of prohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allegation of student academic dishonesty. The following describes procedures for resolution by due process. If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolution begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs the student of the suspicion. If the instructor judges on the basis of available evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severity of the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, \"F\" on the particular assignment, or \"F\" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair and the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the matter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom. Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor's decision, the student will contact the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or designate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department. The department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only role is to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty member from a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the Office of Student Life will arrange for the participation of the student panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair. The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a particular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon a belief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evaluation and therefore will not review the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student. After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of the recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student and the Office of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course. Decisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are intended to be confidential. If the student wishes to withdraw from the course, the instructor's approval is required for the withdrawal process. The instructor may refuse to approve of the withdrawal and may assign an appropriate grade. University Judicial Process When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files. If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the severity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integrity violations. Allegations Outside a Course If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved.

"},"chapter-8/AdministrativePoliciesandRegulations.html":{"url":"chapter-8/AdministrativePoliciesandRegulations.html","title":"Administrative Policies and Regulations","keywords":"","body":"Administrative Policies and Regulations Clery Act In accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, Santa Clara University annually collects information about campus crimes and other reportable incidents as defined by the law. Information presented in compliance with this act is made available to assist current and potential students and employees in making informed decisions regarding their attendance or employment at the University. These reports and other information about the law are available on the Campus Safety website. It is the policy of Santa Clara University that the campus community will be informed on a timely basis of all reports of crime and other information affecting the security of our campus and the personal safety of our students, faculty, staff, and guests. Communication by the University to Undergraduate Students The University will communicate with undergraduate students through a variety of formats. Information that is sent to undergraduate students from the University via their campus mailbox, local address, or their Santa Clara email address is considered official communication and should be treated as such. Students are asked to check their campus mailbox and their Santa Clara email account on a daily basis, and are responsible for reading and responding to the information they receive from the University. The University urges undergraduate students to use their Santa Clara email address as their primary email; students who will not be checking that address regularly should forward their email to their preferred email account. Consensual Relations Between Employees and Students In addition to prohibiting sexual harassment under the Policy on Unlawful Harassment and Unlawful Discrimination, the University prohibits any consensual dating, romantic, or sexual relationship between an employee and a student over whom that employee has any instructional, supervisory, advising, or evaluative responsibility. Such a relationship is fraught with problems, including the potential for exploitation, favoritism, and conflict of interest. The appearance of impropriety or unfairness may also adversely affect the learning and work environment for other students and employees. This policy applies to faculty, staff, and student employees. Employees who violate this policy are subject to sanctions for misconduct under the policies of the Faculty Handbook, Staff Policy Manual, or Student Employment Handbook, as appropriate to their employment status. Employees or students with questions about this policy should contact the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX or the Department of Human Resources. Drug-free Workplace and School Program It is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University's activities. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace even if it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct. The unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and campus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clara premises where the activities of the University are conducted. Violations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. The program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and students. New staff employees are given a copy at New Employee Orientation. New faculty employees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation. The program is reviewed at least biennially by the Office of Student Life and the Department of Human Resources. Notice of Student Rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) is the federal law that protects the confidentiality of the educational records of students maintained by the University and affords students certain rights with respect to those records. A student is any person who attends or has attended a class at the University, which includes courses taken through videoconference, satellite, internet, or other electronic and telecommunication technologies. Students' rights under FERPA include: The right to inspect and review educational records Students have the right to inspect and review their education records. Students should submit a written request to the Office of the Registrar that specifies what records the students would like to inspect and review. Within 45 days of receipt of the request, the Office of the Registrar will make arrangements for access and will notify students of the time and place where the records may be reviewed. The right to seek amendment to educational records Students have the right to request the amendment of their educational records to ensure that those records are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of students' privacy or other rights. Students who wish to seek an amendment to a record should write the University Registrar, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it should be changed. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested, the University will notify students in writing of the decision and their right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to students when notified of the right to a hearing. The right to consent to disclosure of educational records Students have the right to consent to the disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in their educational records. In some instances, the University may disclose personally identifiable information from a student's educational record without the student's consent. One such instance is to a school official who has a legitimate educational interest in the record. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position; a person elected to the Board of Trustees; or a person or entity under contract with the University who has been designated a school official by the University and is performing specific duties for the University that require a legitimate educational interest. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review any educational records in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. The University is authorized under provisions of FERPA to release directory information without the student's prior consent, unless a student explicitly requests in writing that the University not do so and keep directory information confidential. Directory information is designated as follows: Name Address: Campus post office box, local, and permanent addresses (residence hall and room numbers are not disclosed) Telephone number Email address Photograph Date and place of birth Major field of study Classification level/academic standing Dates of attendance (defined as academic year or quarter) Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Weight and height of members of athletic teams Degrees (including expected or actual degree date), honors and awards received, and dates Most recent educational agency or institution attended Students may submit a Request to Prevent Disclosure of Directory Information form to the Office of the Registrar, which directs the University not to disclose directory information. Once filed, the nondisclosure remains in effect until the beginning of the next academic year or a shorter period if designated by a student. Graduating students must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing to remove the nondisclosure from their record. Former or current borrowers of funds from any Title IV student loan program should note carefully that nondisclosure will not prevent the University from releasing information pertinent to employment, enrollment status, current address, and loan account status to a school lender, subsequent holder, guarantee agency, the United States Department of Education, or an authorized agent. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Students have the right to file a complaint with the United States Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. Written complaints should be directed to the Family Policy Compliance Office, Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, D.C. 20202-5920.

Depending on the sport and the student-athlete's eligibility, individual scholarships vary up to the full cost of attendance as defined by NCAA regulations. The Financial Aid Office will coordinate athletic scholarships with other financial aid awards in accordance with applicable federal, state, and University regulations. Community Facilitator Grants Students who are community facilitators in Residential Learning Communities receive a grant generally equivalent to the cost of room and board for their service in that role. The Financial Aid Office will coordinate community facilitator grants with other financial aid awards in accordance with applicable federal, state, and University regulations. Faculty and Staff Tuition Remission Santa Clara University Tuition Remission The Tuition Remission program provides full tuition costs for Santa Clara University eligible employees and their dependents, provided the employee is working 30 hours or more per week. Employees working 20--29 hours per week will receive tuition remission for themselves only, on a prorated basis. Tuition remission does not include other costs, such as books, laboratory, application, service, and other fees. All charges other than tuition must be paid to the University in the same manner as required of other students. Please contact the Human Resources Department for additional eligibility requirements, such as years of service. FACHEX FACHEX is an acronym for Faculty, Administrators, and Staff Children Exchange. It is an undergraduate tuition remission program for children of full-time faculty and staff to apply the same benefit at participating Jesuit colleges and universities if selected by a participating college. Children of eligible employees may apply for undergraduate admission to one of the participating Jesuit colleges and universities and, if accepted, are eligible for consideration of a full tuition scholarship subject to the terms and conditions set by the accepting institution. FACHEX scholarships are not a guaranteed award. They must be offered by the accepting institution. Each member institution is obligated to maintain a balance between students sent on the exchange (exports) and students received on the exchange (imports). FACHEX eligibility does not qualify a dependent child for admission, nor does an offer of admission to a participating Jesuit university guarantee a FACHEX Award. Full-time faculty and staff with at least three years of continuous service are eligible to apply for their dependent children. Tuition Exchange Awards The Tuition Exchange program is a national undergraduate scholarship exchange program for institutions of higher education. Children of eligible employees may apply for undergraduate admission to one of the participating institutions and, if accepted, are eligible for consideration of a tuition scholarship subject to the terms and conditions set by the accepting institution. Tuition Exchange, Inc. is a partnership of over 675 colleges and universities offering competitive tuition exchange scholarships. Tuition Exchange scholarships are not a guaranteed award.

Note: The Federal Pell Grant, as with all federal grants, is subject to federal funding. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) is a need-based grant available to students with the most exceptional need who have not yet received a bachelor's degree. Priority is given to students who are eligible for the Federal Pell Grant and then to other undergraduate students with the greatest demonstrated need. Note: FSEOG, as with all federal grants, is subject to federal funding. Federal Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant program provides grants of up to $4,000 per academic year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families. Eligible students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.25. If the student fails to complete the required service obligation, all amounts of TEACH grants received will be converted to an unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan. Note: The TEACH Grant, as with all federal grants, is subject to federal funding. Cal Grants (for California residents only) Cal Grants are administered by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC). The Cal Grant program provides state-funded awards to California residents based on both academic achievement and financial need. Cal Grant A provides funds for partial tuition and fees. Cal Grant B recipients receive a subsistence award the first year and receive a subsistence award and tuition award in subsequent years. Note: Cal Grants, as with all state grants, are subject to state funding. Other Grants and Scholarships Army ROTC Scholarships Scholarships are awarded to undergraduate students through the Army Reserve Officers Training Program (ROTC). Two-year, three-year, and four-year scholarships are awarded under the program to eligible ROTC students. The ROTC scholarships may cover full tuition from funds provided by the Army and may cover standard on-campus room and board charges from a University grant. Recipients may also receive a tax-free stipend during the academic year and an allowance for books and other educational items. Students who accept Army ROTC scholarships incur a military obligation that can be fulfilled by serving part-time in the Army National Guard or Army Reserve, or by serving full time on Army active duty. Students must maintain satisfactory academic progress as defined by Santa Clara University. Note: This scholarship may not exceed the amount of tuition; part-time attendance may cause a reduction to this scholarship. Private Scholarships Students receiving private scholarships must notify the Financial Aid Office if they are receiving any other form of financial aid. Private scholarship checks should be sent by the awarding organization to the Financial Aid Office to ensure appropriate and timely processing. The Financial Aid Office will coordinate private scholarships with other financial aid awards in accordance with applicable federal, state, and University regulations. Student Employment Campus Employment Part-time jobs for undergraduate students are available in many offices and departments on campus. Campus job listings are maintained by the Student Employment Office. Students earn an hourly wage at least at the current minimum wage rate for the state of California and may be paid at a higher rate depending on the type of work or skills required. Federal Work-Study Program The Federal Work-Study Program is a need-based student employment program under which students can work up to 19 hours per week on campus or through an approved off-campus site. Students earn an hourly wage at least at the current minimum wage rate for the state of California and may be paid at a higher rate depending on the type of work or skills required. Students receive a paycheck each period and can use the money for educational or living expenses. Earnings under the program are taxable. Loans William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans are federally funded low-interest loans provided to undergraduate students and administered by the United States Department of Education. Under the Federal Direct Loan program, a student may borrow funds for educationally related expenses and defer repayment until six months after graduation or when the enrollment status drops below half-time (e.g., less than 6 units). If an undergraduate is an independent student or a dependent student whose parents were denied for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, the student can borrow additional funds through the Federal Direct Loan program based on their academic grade level. To receive a subsidized Federal Direct Loan, a student must have financial need. Interest is not charged on a subsidized Federal Direct Loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time. Eligibility for unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans is determined after eligibility for subsidized Federal Direct Loans is decided. Interest accrues on unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans during all periods, including while the student is enrolled in school and during any grace or deferment periods. Federal Direct PLUS Loan A parent or stepparent of a dependent student may apply for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program to help cover the cost of educational expenses. To be eligible for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, a student must be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen and must be enrolled at least half-time. A parent may borrow up to the cost of attendance minus all other financial aid for each undergraduate child. An origination fee is deducted from the disbursement of the loan. Financial Aid Eligibility Enrollment Status and Financial Aid Eligibility Undergraduate students receiving financial aid must meet general University eligibility requirements and any applicable eligibility criteria associated with specific federal, state, or University aid programs from which they are receiving support. Financial aid recipients generally must be enrolled as full-time students in a minimum of 12 units each quarter in which aid is received, must be making satisfactory progress toward a degree, and must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. Financial aid awards to students who drop below full-time status (e.g., less than 12 units) will be adjusted unless certification for continuing eligibility is granted by the Financial Aid Office. Eligibility for institutional financial aid is limited to a maximum of 12 consecutive academic quarters of undergraduate study. Financial aid awards will cease after the 12 quarters of enrollment in a postsecondary institution unless certification for continuing eligibility is granted by the Financial Aid Office. Specific financial aid awards may have additional requirements for continuing eligibility. The U.S. Department of Education has basic eligibility requirements for financial aid, which must be met and maintained in order for a student to be eligible to receive aid. These requirements apply to all federal, state, and Santa Clara University--funded aid. A student must \"be enrolled in an eligible program as a regular student seeking a degree or certificate.\" Students cannot be awarded aid for classes that do not count toward their degree, certificate, or other recognized credential. In short, students are only eligible for federal, state, and University-funded aid when taking classes that are required to complete a degree (either major or minor). Once those degree requirements have been met and a student is eligible to graduate, he or she is no longer entitled to receive aid. This holds true even if the student has been here fewer than 12 academic quarters. Students who are able to graduate because they have completed all of their degree requirements but decide to enroll for an additional term are not eligible to receive federal, state, or University-funded aid for the additional term. Students who believe that they may be impacted by the U.S Department of Education regulations should reach out to a financial aid counselor to discuss their particular circumstances. The University has developed responses to some frequently asked questions. Academic Standing and Satisfactory Progress Requirements All financial aid recipients must maintain good academic standing and be making satisfactory progress toward a degree according to the University standards and applicable federal and state regulations. Students are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress each quarter. Qualitatively Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. Note: Some Santa Clara University aid programs require a higher cumulative grade point average than the federal minimum requirement. Quantitatively Students must maintain a cumulative 67 percent completion rate for all units attempted toward their academic programs. Maximum Attempted Units Allowed Students must complete the requirements for their academic programs within 150 percent of the minimum units required to complete their academic programs. Units attempted also include all units transferred into Santa Clara University from prior institutions that can be used to satisfy students' academic program requirements. Students who have reached their maximum attempted units allowed are ineligible for additional financial aid. Students may appeal for financial aid probation status if they feel their circumstances warrant an exception to this standard. Unit Requirements All financial aid recipients must register for and maintain a full course load of 12 units or more per quarter, if the aid was awarded on this basis. Students who drop below 12 units may see their financial aid adjusted. Full-time and part-time status is defined as follows: Full-time: 12 or more units Three-fourths time: 9 to 11 units Half-time: 6 to 8 units Less than half-time: fewer than 6 units Course Incompletes, Withdrawal, Failures, and/or Repetitions Incompletes (I), Withdrawals (W), Failures (F), and/or repeated courses will adversely affect a student's completion rate. Students must complete the minimum number of units to fulfill federal, state, and University requirements. Completion rates are calculated cumulatively and will include all quarters that the student was enrolled, whether or not the student received financial aid. Students who wish to withdraw from Santa Clara University during a quarter must complete a withdrawal form and an exit interview in the Drahmann Advising and Learning Resource Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's registration will be canceled without academic penalty. A withdrawal notation (W) will be assigned for each course from which the student withdraws after the fourth week of the quarter. Students who leave Santa Clara University during a quarter without formally withdrawing are subject to failing grades in all courses in which they were registered and are ineligible for refund of fees. IMPORTANT: Any student leaving Santa Clara University at the conclusion of any quarter should also complete the standard withdrawal process. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than C minus (C-). In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the calculation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and performance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion. Evaluation All students enrolled at Santa Clara University are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress at the end of each quarter after the Office of Registrar has released official grades. Appeal Process There may be extenuating circumstances encountered by a student that affect his/her ability to be academically successful during an enrollment period. These circumstances include personal injury or illness that occurs during an enrollment period; death of an immediate family member or legal guardian during an enrollment period; or other documented circumstances that were unexpected in nature and beyond control of the student. In these cases, cumulative grade point average or completion rate may decline resulting in the student not meeting the minimum qualitative and quantitative standards previously described. If the student wishes to appeal the suspension from financial aid eligibility, a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal form must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office. If the appeal is approved, s/he will be placed on financial aid probation (separate from academic probation). Students will be notified of the appeal results in writing. Loss of Eligibility A student who has lost eligibility to participate in federal, state, and University aid programs for reasons of academic progress can regain that eligibility only by enrolling at Santa Clara University at his/her own expense. The mere passage of time will not restore eligibility to a student who has lost eligibility for failure to make satisfactory academic progress. Students who have been dismissed from Santa Clara University for academic reasons, but who are subsequently readmitted are not automatically eligible to participate in federal, state, or institutional aid programs and will be placed on financial aid warning. Re-admission decisions are separate from funding decisions. Regaining Eligibility Students who failed to meet satisfactory academic progress and who choose to enroll without financial aid may request a review of their academic record after any term in which they are enrolled without the receipt of financial aid. If the standards are met at the time of review, eligibility may be regained for subsequent terms of enrollment in the academic year. Other Program Eligibility Study Abroad Programs Santa Clara University students participating in study abroad and domestic public sector study programs operated by or affiliated with the University are eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid and tuition remission as well as federal and state aid consistent with the policies and practices applicable to students enrolled for on-campus classes. Tuition and room and board rates associated with the specific program will be factored into the determination of the financial aid award consistent with applicable policies and practices. The total amount of tuition remission for the academic year cannot exceed the annual tuition rate for that year. Students with private scholarships should contact the donor for prior approval to use funds for study abroad or domestic study programs. Students from other colleges and universities enrolled in Santa Clara University study abroad programs are not eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid. Veterans and Veterans' Dependents Assistance Santa Clara University has been certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 percent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill¬Æ), Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill¬Æ), and Yellow Ribbon. Individuals interested in attending under any of the veteran assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar. GI Bill¬Æ is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill. Cancellation of Financial Aid and Return of Funds Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are subject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal financial aid funds governed under Title IV other than those earned under the college work-study program. Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to state or University financial aid programs or to the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received Federal Title IV assistance: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans) Subsidized Federal Direct Loans Federal Direct PLUS Loans Federal Pell Grants for which a return is required Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants for which a return is required TEACH Grants for which a return is required Iraq and Afghanistan Grants for which a return is required Student Verification of Information The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students and their families submit as a basis for the award of aid. Each year, a percentage of students receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the information on which their awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid and to verify the attendance of other children in college. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds. Billing and Payment Procedures Student Accounts and Billing Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures. Students may designate a third party (e.g., parent, family member, spouse) to be an authorized user for the purpose of reviewing student account/billing information and remitting payments on the student's behalf. However, it is ultimately the student's responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the published deadlines. Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through University eCampus. Billing notification will be sent to the student's assigned SCU gmail account and to the email address of any authorized user. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remittance. Information on a student's account cannot be provided to any third party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University. Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees associated with their enrollment status by the published term payment deadline. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to prepay for their enrollment. Registered students who do not withdraw formally from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their account as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees. Payment Methods Santa Clara University offers a variety of payment methods to students and their parents to assist with their financial obligations. Payment by Electronic Check A student or authorized user may make online payments by authorizing a fund transfer directly from their personal checking or savings account through a third-party website accessible via the University eCampus system. The payer is able to make electronic check payments online without incurring a transaction fee. Payment by Mail Payments for student account charges are accepted by mail utilizing the University's cash management service lockbox. The payer should download a copy of the student's billing statement, enclose it with a personal or cashier's check payable to \"Santa Clara University,\" and mail both items to: SCU Payment Processing, P.O. Box 550, Santa Clara, CA 95052-0550. Payment in Person Payments for student account charges may be made in person by cash or check only at the OneStop Office located in the Admissions and Enrollment Services Building. The Office is not able to accept any electronic form of payment. However, there are computer kiosks located in the Admissions and Enrollment Services Building for the convenience of students and their payers who wish to make electronic payments. The University does not accept credit cards as payment for student account charges. Extended Payment Options For students and their families wishing to spread payments over a period of time, the University offers term payment plans, which are available through the online billing system via eCampus. There is a modest, non refundable, fixed fee to enroll in these plans, but no interest is charged during the payment term. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar's Office website. Delinquent Payments If all charges on a student's account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student's account and a hold will be placed on the student's account. A hold on a student's account prevents the release of diplomas or certificates, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default in accordance with California state law. Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recovering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University. Refunds and Payment Policies Students may be eligible for a refund if they have a credit balance on their account. Refunds are processed after the add/drop period of each term/semester. Payment received by personal check will have a 14 calendar day hold before a refund can be issued. A seven calendar day hold applies for electronic check payments. Refunds will not be processed for any overpayment on the account unless the student has withdrawn or dropped units causing a credit balance. The University has partnered with A.W.G. Dewar, Inc. to provide a low-cost, tuition insurance protection plan. This plan protects students and their families against financial loss due to an unexpected complete withdrawal from the University, for diagnosed medical or mental health reasons. Beginning with the Fall 2020 academic quarter, Santa Clara will charge the tuition insurance plan to the student's account. Students can choose to opt-out of the tuition insurance plan by completing a waiver on the Dewar website prior to the first day of the academic quarter. Information on the waiver and tuition insurance plan is available on the Bursar's Office website. Billing Disputes If a student wishes to dispute any charge on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar's Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar's Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the disputed charge appeared. Communication can be made by telephone, but doing so will not preserve the student's rights. Communication should include the student's name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress. However, all other charges need to be paid by the payment deadlines. If the disputed amount is deemed to be invalid, then an adjustment will be made on the student's account. If the amount in question is found to be valid, payment must be submitted to the Bursar's Office immediately upon notification.

Additionally, it is the University's policy that there shall be no discrimination or retaliation against employees or students who raise issues of discrimination or potential discrimination or who participate in the investigation of such issues. The Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX coordinates and oversees the prompt response, impartial and thorough investigation, and equitable and timely resolution to all instances of discrimination and harassment, sexual harassment, and other forms sexual misconduct involving students, faculty, and staff. The Director also tracks incidents and trends involving sexual misconduct, and serves as the principal contact for government and external inquiries regarding civil rights compliance and Title IX. Inquiries about this policy or to report an incident of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, or sexual misconduct should contact: Belinda GuthrieOffice of Equal Opportunity and Title IXSanta Clara UniversityLoyola Hall, Suite 140425 El Camino RealSanta Clara, CA 95050(408) 554-3043 www.scu.edu/title-ix/ Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 Title IX is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on the sex or gender of students and employees in educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX states that: \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\" Title IX promotes equity in academics and athletics programs and activities, and prohibits all forms of sex and gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment and sexual violence. Title IX also prohibits discrimination against a student based on pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery from any of these conditions. Students may request adjustments and accommodations based on pregnancy needs or on a pregnancy-related complication for as long as the student's doctor deems the accommodation to be medically necessary. Requests for pregnancy-related accommodations should be directed to Disabilities Resources at 408-554-4109 or to the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, Loyola Hall, Suite 140, 408-551-3043.

Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy Santa Clara University is committed to providing an environment free of gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual violence and assault, relationship (dating and domestic) violence, and stalking. The University provides resources and reporting options to students, faculty, and staff to address concerns related to gender-based discrimination and sexual misconduct prohibited by Title IX and University policy, and, through training and education, works to prevent its occurrence. The University seeks to provide a consistent, caring, and timely response when sexual and gender-based misconduct occurs within the University community. When the University becomes aware of allegations of sexual misconduct, it will take prompt and effective action. This action may include an initial assessment of safety and well-being, implementing interim remedies at no cost to the complainant for protection and support, discussing how the complainant wishes to proceed, initiating an investigation, and identifying appropriate avenues for resolution. The University's response will be overseen by the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX. The University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy applies to all students, faculty, and staff, and includes any individual regularly or temporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or serving in an official capacity at Santa Clara University (including volunteers and contractors). The policy applies to both on-campus and off-campus conduct and to online actions that have a potential or actual adverse impact on any member of the University community, or which substantially interferes with a person's ability to participate in University activities, or which could affect a substantial University interest or its educational mission. For more information about reporting, response, and adjudication, please see the University's Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy or contact the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, www.scu.edu/title-ix. What Constitutes Consent The University adheres to California's definition of affirmative consent for sexual activity. Affirmative consent means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Since individuals may experience the same interaction in different ways, it is the responsibility of each party to determine that the other has consented before engaging in the activity. For consent to be valid, there must be a clear expression in words or actions that the other individual consented to that specific sexual conduct. Reasonable reciprocation can be implied. For example, if someone kisses you, you can kiss them back (if you want to) without the need to explicitly obtain their consent to being kissed back. Consent can also be withdrawn once given, as long as the withdrawal is reasonably and clearly communicated. If consent is withdrawn, that sexual activity should cease. Consent to some sexual contact (such as kissing or fondling) cannot be presumed to be consent for other sexual activity (such as intercourse). A current or previous intimate relationship is not sufficient to constitute consent. Consent is based on the totality of the circumstances evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances, including the context in which the alleged incident occurred and any similar previous patterns that may be evidenced. The question of whether the responding party should have known of the reporting party's incapacity is an objective inquiry as to what a reasonable person, exercising sober judgment, would have known, in the same or similar circumstances. Consent is not voluntary if forced or coerced. Force is the use of physical violence or physical imposition to gain sexual access. Force also includes threats, intimidation (implied threats), and coercion that is intended to overcome resistance or produce consent Coercion is unreasonable pressure for sexual activity. Sexual activity that is forced is, by definition, non-consensual, but non-consensual sexual activity is not necessarily forced. Silence or the absence of resistance alone is not consent. Consent is not demonstrated by the absence of resistance. While resistance is not required or necessary, it is a clear demonstration of non-consent. A person cannot consent if they are unable to understand what is happening, asleep, or unconscious for any reason. A person violates this policy if they engage in sexual activity with someone they know to be, or should know to be, physically or mentally incapacitated. This policy also covers a person whose incapacity results from a temporary or permanent physical or mental health condition, involuntary physical restraint, or the consumption of incapacitating drug or alcohol. Incapacitation occurs when someone cannot make rational, reasonable decisions because they lack the capacity to give knowing/informed consent (e.g. to understand the \"who, what, when, where, why, or how\" of their sexual interaction). Incapacitation is determined through consideration of all relevant indicators of an individual's state and is not synonymous with (under the) influence, impairment, intoxication, inebriation, blackout, or being drunk. It is not an excuse that the responding party was intoxicated and, therefore, did not realize the incapacity of the reporting party. Reporting Options There are confidential and non-confidential reporting options available. Confidential Resources include on and off campus mental counselors, health service providers, local rape crisis counselors, domestic violence resources, and members of the clergy and chaplains. Confidential on-campus resources include CAPS, Cowell Center, 408-554-4501; Wellness Center, 862 Market Street, 408-554-4409; and members of the clergy or chaplains. Confidential means that what a reporting party shares will not be communicated with anyone else unless except in extreme cases of immediacy of threat or abuse of a minor. Reporting to Law Enforcement For immediate, emergency assistance or to report a crime of sexual violence, including sexual assault, domestic/intimate partner violence, and stalking students, contact the Santa Clara Police Department, dial 911, or contact Campus Safety Services at 408-554-4444. Reporting to the University To report an incident to the University, students may: ¬∑ Report directly to the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX ¬∑ Report online at https://www.scu.edu/title-ix/reporting/ ¬∑ Report anonymously using EthicsPoint at www.scu.edu/hr/quick-links/ethicspoint/ Other campus reporting options: Students may report incidents and seek support from other University officials, including: ¬∑ The Office of Student Life, ¬∑ The Office of Residence Life (including Community Facilitators, Resident Directors, Assistant Resident Directors, Neighborhood Representatives, and Assistant Area Coordinators), ¬∑ Spirituality Facilitators, ¬∑ The Office of Housing, ¬∑ Athletics and Recreation, ¬∑ The Center for Student Leadership, ¬∑ The Drahmann Center, ¬∑ Disabilities Resources, ¬∑ The Career Center, and ¬∑ Campus Ministry. Theses University resources are required to report incidents to the Director of Equal Opportunity and Title IX, who will oversee investigation and resolution process. At the time a report is made, a complainant does not have to decide whether or not to request or participate in an investigation or University resolution process.
