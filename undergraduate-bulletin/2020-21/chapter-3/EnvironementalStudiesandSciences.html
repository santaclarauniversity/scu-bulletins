<p>The Department of Environmental Studies and Sciences (ESS) offers interdisciplinary programs of study leading to a bachelor of science in environmental science or environmental studies. A minor in environmental studies is also available. These programs provide students with the intellectual foundation they will need in addressing crucial environmental challenges of the 21st century such as human population growth, urban development, food and agricultural systems, deforestation, global climate change, waste disposal, air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity, and the need for renewable energy.</p>
<p>ESS programs are enriched by colloquia featuring presentations on environmental topics by scholars and practitioners. Majors in ESS are expected to apply their knowledge outside the classroom by completing an approved internship or research experience. During their senior year, ESS students conduct research or an interdisciplinary group project with community stakeholders in ENVS 101 (Capstone Seminar).</p>
<p>ESS students are encouraged to study abroad. Courses such as ENVS 144 (Natural History of Baja L&amp;L) include one week of immersion travel during University academic year breaks. Some summer and academic year courses taken through approved study abroad programs will count toward the requirements of the environmental studies and sciences majors and minors.</p>
<p>Each student works with a faculty advisor, who helps integrate the classroom curriculum with the student&apos;s plans for future study and/or work in environmental fields.</p>

We will explore climate change in three broad units: (1) foundational aspects of the climate system such as Earth&apos;s energy balance, greenhouse effect, carbon cycle, and circulation of the oceans and atmosphere; (2) evolution of the climate system throughout Earth&apos;s history; and (3) impacts, vulnerabilities, and solutions for modern climate change. Students will model Earth&apos;s energy balance, examine Earth&apos;s carbon and water cycles in the field and lab, experimentally determine sea level rise with water isotopes, and use climate models to predict future changes. Lectures and discussions of current scientific literature and government documents will be motivated by student interest. Laboratory 30 hours. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="185-garbology">185. Garbology</h3>
<p>This class follows the path of our waste products as they are landfilled, burned, treated, recycled, reused, dumped on minority communities, or shipped abroad.
