<p>The Public Health Program in the College of Arts and Sciences offers the bachelor of science degree in public health science. The program also offers a minor degree in public health, and manages the Global Health Pathway of the University Core.</p>
<p>The public health science (PHS) major is an interdisciplinary degree focused on the health of human populations and individuals. Students will gain a solid foundation in biology and chemistry to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease. The major further explores the influences of environmental and social factors on human health through required and elective public health courses, as well as relevant courses in the social sciences and humanities. Through the senior capstone and mandatory internship, PHS majors engage in health-focused service and research projects that apply their education to real-world public health problems, and integrate learning across disciplines. Students are encouraged to study abroad to gain perspective on global health issues.</p>
<p>Public health science majors will be well-prepared for careers, graduate education, or professional training in public health or health-related professions, including medicine and nursing. There are many career options in the field of public health, including health care administration, planning, and public policy; epidemiology and disease surveillance; clinical research and clinical trials management; health-related education and social work; health and science communication; and basic research.</p>
<p>Students intending to pursue a medical degree, or postgraduate training in other health-related professions, should contact the University pre-health advisor to discuss prerequisites for admission to such programs. Many require a full year of physics coursework (e.g., PHYS 11-13 or 31-33) in addition to the requirements for the public health science major.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major-in-public-health-science-health-science-emphasis">Requirements for the Major in Public Health Science: Health Science Emphasis</h2>
<p>In addition to fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students must complete the following courses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PHSC 1, 2, 3, 100, 139, 150, 190, 197</p>
</li>
<li><p>BIOL 1A, 1B, 1C</p>
</li>
<li><p>CHEM 11, 12, 31, 32, 33</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two approved introductory social science courses</p>
</li>
<li><p>MATH 35, 36 (recommended) or MATH 11, 12</p>
</li>
<li><p>One statistics course chosen from MATH 8, ANTH 112, BIOL 160, COMM 110, ENVS 110, OMIS 40, PHSC 50, PSYC 40, SOCI 120</p>
</li>
<li><p>One public health elective: Any PHSC course other than the required courses listed above</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two approved upper-division biomedical electives, at least one with a lab component</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two approved upper-division social science or humanities electives</p>

<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major-in-public-health-science-health-and-society-emphasis">Requirements for the Major in Public Health Science: Health and Society Emphasis</h2>
<p>In addition to fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students must complete the following courses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#xB7; PHSC 1, 2, 3, 50, 100, 125, 139, 150, 175, 190, 197</p>
<p>&#xB7; BIOL 2 or BIOL 1A</p>
<p>&#xB7; A total of six approved introductory social science courses, chosen from two departments</p>
<p>&#xB7; MATH 35</p>
<p>&#xB7; One approved upper-division PHSC elective</p>
<p>&#xB7; Three approved upper-division electives from social science departments or PHSC</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Internship Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The PHS major requires students to complete at least 100 hours of public health-related internship work. Internships must be approved in advance by a faculty member in the Public Health Program. Internships can be done on a part-time or full-time basis, during the academic year or summer. Students may receive course credit for volunteer internships. For guidance on and approval of internships, students should contact one of the Public Health Program faculty.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-minor">Requirements for the Minor</h2>
<p>The interdisciplinary public health minor provides an introduction to the field of public health and is particularly useful for students interested in careers related to medicine, health care, community health, social work, education, or public policy. The minor establishes a sound scientific foundation to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease and to appreciate the mechanisms by which diseases arise and spread in populations. Students also develop a foundation in the social sciences and statistical methods. Upper-division courses address the influences of biological, environmental, cultural, economic, and historical factors on human health. Students are encouraged to study abroad, if possible, to gain perspective on global health issues. The Public Health Program is evolving and students are encouraged to petition the director of the Public Health Program to consider new relevant courses developed at Santa Clara University and partner institutions abroad in addition to the approved electives.</p>

<h2 id="lower-division-courses">Lower-Division Courses</h2>
<h3 id="1-introduction-to-public-health">1. Introduction to Public Health</h3>
<p>As an introduction to public health, this course examines health at the population level. Topics include common infectious and chronic diseases, how diseases arise in individuals and populations, how diseases are studied, and how health is promoted at the individual and community levels. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="2-the-american-health-system">2. The American Health System</h3>
<p>This course examines the fundamental aspects of the U.S. health system including organization, delivery, financing, cost, access, and quality. The focus will be on the current system, but significant attention will be given to its historical roots and to alternative approaches implemented in other developed countries. Potential policy reforms and the interface of the health care system with public health will also be discussed. Prerequisite: PHSC 1. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="3-introduction-to-community-health">3. Introduction to Community Health</h3>
<p>This course is an introduction to community health designed for public health majors and minors. Students will investigate health from a community perspective at multiple levels---governmental, nonprofit organization, activist/member. Students will learn how to define &quot;communities&quot; for public health practice and research, and experience community health work with multiple stakeholders. This is a hybrid between classroom and field-based learning that will allow students to learn theories and frameworks of community health, while examining these principles in practice. Prerequisite: PHSC 1. (4 units)</p>
