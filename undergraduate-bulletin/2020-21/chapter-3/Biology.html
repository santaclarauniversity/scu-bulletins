<p>The Department of Biology offers a program leading to the bachelor of science degree. The major provides students a solid foundation in the core concepts of modern biological thought, and provides students with critical skills to put concepts into practice. The biology major serves as a strong foundation for graduate, medical, or professional studies, as well as for careers in teaching, research, and business. Most courses emphasize laboratory or field work, and students are also encouraged to work with faculty on research projects. Most faculty members involve students in their research programs. Qualified students can obtain course credit for research by enrolling in BIOL 195, and for major research projects by enrolling in BIOL 198. Minor degrees in biology and related disciplines (biotechnology, biomedical engineering, public health, and environmental studies) are available. The Biology Department also offers the fundamental introductory curriculum for all of life science majors, as well as courses that satisfy the Natural Science and Science, Technology &amp; Society requirements of the Core Curriculum, the latter of which are available to all University students who are curious about the nature of life. Numerous study abroad opportunities in the life sciences, both for biology majors and nonmajors, are available through the Study Abroad office.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major">Requirements for the Major</h2>
<p>In addition to fulfilling the undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students majoring in biology must complete the following departmental requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>BIOL 1A, 1B, and 1C</p>
</li>
<li><p>CHEM 11, 12, 31, 32, and 33</p>
</li>
<li><p>PHYS 11, 12, 13 or PHYS 31, 32, 33</p>
</li>
<li><p>MATH 35 and 36 (recommended) or MATH 11 and 12</p>
</li>
<li><p>BIOL 101</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seven approved upper-division biology courses, including five with a laboratory component</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are advised to take at least one upper-division course each from one of five biological &quot;concepts&quot; categories (Evolution, Information Flow, Structure-Function, Systems, and Transformations of Energy and Matter). Students are also advised to take at least one upper-division course that focuses on the use of modeling and simulation to solve biological problems.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-minor">Requirements for the Minor</h2>
<p>Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in biology:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Successful completion of BIOL 1C</p>
</li>
<li><p>Three upper-division biology courses, including two with a laboratory component</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minors-in-related-areas">Minors in Related Areas</h3>
<p><strong>Biotechnology Minor:</strong> This minor is designed for students interested in gaining insight into the science underlying biotechnology, exploring its potential for the future, and obtaining practical experience in laboratory techniques used in biotechnology research and its applications. See the Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study section at the end of this chapter for details.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Studies Minor:</strong> This minor provides an opportunity for students to focus on environmental issues through a variety of academic approaches in the humanities, social and natural sciences, engineering, and law. See the Department of Environmental Studies and Sciences section in this chapter for details.</p>
<p><strong>Biomedical Engineering Minor:</strong> This minor is designed primarily for science majors in the College of Arts and Sciences. This minor could be a valuable asset for science majors interested in biomedical research and/or health-related careers, including those completing prerequisites for medical school and other health-related professional schools. See Chapter 5, School of Engineering, for details.</p>
<p><strong>Public Health Minor:</strong> This minor is designed for students interested in population level analysis of health issues, and the causes and consequences of disease. See the Public Health Program section in this chapter for details.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-in-biology-for-admission-to-teacher-training-credential-programs">Preparation in Biology for Admission to Teacher Training Credential Programs</h2>
<p>The State of California requires that students seeking a credential to teach biology in California secondary schools must pass the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET), a subject area competency examination. Students who are contemplating secondary school teaching in biology should consult with the coordinator in the Department of Biology as early as possible. The secondary teaching credential requires the completion of an approved credential program that can be completed as a fifth year of study and student teaching, or internship.</p>
<h2 id="lower-division-courses">Lower-Division Courses</h2>
<h3 id="1a-transformations-of-energy-and-matter-ll">1A. Transformations of Energy and Matter L&amp;L</h3>
<p>How do organisms obtain elements from their environment, change them to suit their growth needs, and acquire the energy necessary to sustain life? How do changing environments impact organisms and ecosystems? Students will explore the global cycle of critical elements and dissect the chemical reactions that incorporate these elements into biological molecules and new biological structures. They will discuss the implications of nutrient availability on growth of a variety of organisms and on interacting populations in an ecosystem. Core to this class is the exploration of the habits of mind that will form the basis of critical scientific thinking throughout the biology curriculum. Laboratory 15 hours. Prerequisite: concurrent enrollment in or completion of CHEM 12. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="1b-information-and-evolution-ll">1B. Information and Evolution L&amp;L</h3>
<p>This course builds an introductory understanding of how information is transmitted and utilized in biological systems. Students will investigate how the genetic transmission of information at the molecular, organismal, and population level generates biodiversity and drives evolution. In their studies, students will continue to practice the habits of mind necessary to critically evaluate data and communicate with the greater scientific community. Laboratory 15 hours. Prerequisites: completion of BIOL 1A with a C- or better, and concurrent enrollment in or completion of CHEM 31 (or 13). (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="1c-systems-ll">1C. Systems L&amp;L</h3>
<p>All biological phenomena are complex networks whose members comprise molecules, cells, organs, organisms, and ecosystems. An alteration affecting one of the members could affect the entire network. In this course, students will model biological systems (e.g., organismal body plans, human diseases, endangered natural habitats) in order to predict how they will respond and adapt. Students will also apply the process of science to collect, analyze, and interpret data across biological scales and communicate with the greater scientific community. Laboratory 30 hours. Prerequisites: completion of BIOL 1B with a C- or better and completion of CHEM 31 (or 13). (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="2-human-biology-ll">2. Human Biology L&amp;L</h3>
<p>This course will provide an overview of the biology of the human body. Students will explore the normal function of major organ systems at the physiological, cellular and molecular levels. We will discuss topics such as chronic and infectious diseases, immunity, nutrition, genetics, fitness, reproduction and inheritance. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="3-fitness-physiology-ll">3. Fitness Physiology L&amp;L</h3>
<p>Although many people rarely engage in vigorous exercise, as a species we evolved to perform prolonged, strenuous activity. This course surveys how exercise promotes a state of wellness and explores both the immediate responses to exercise as well as how the body responds to long-term training programs. In addition to learning basic human physiology, at the end of the course students should be able to critique and design experiments, understand and interpret reports of health and exercise news in the popular press, critically evaluate fitness claims made by advertisers, and recognize quackery.
