<p><em>Professor Emeritus:</em> Stephen Fugita</p>
<p><em>Professors:</em> James S. Lai, Anna Sampaio (Department Chair)</p>
<p><em>Associate Professors:</em> Anthony Q. Hazard Jr.</p>
<p><em>Assistant Professor:</em> Jesica Fern&#xE1;ndez</p>
<p><em>Lecturer:</em> Allia Griffin</p>
<p>Ethnic studies is a compelling and dynamic discipline devoted to the critical examination of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and intersecting modes of inequality particularly as manifest in the experiences of historically marginalized populations. In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities while building on the critical studies of racialization and resistance with research and courses across a broad field including education, economic development, identity and empowerment, immigration, labor and employment, media, music, and popular culture, multiracial communities, sovereignty, transnational networks, voting rights, and political representation. Ethnic studies focuses on the roles and experiences of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations with particular attention paid to African Americans/Blacks, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans, Chicanas/os/xs and Latinas/os/xs and American Indian/Native Americans within the framework of the United States and within transnational networks. Coursework also emphasizes the comparative interaction between various racial/ethnic groups and cross-national approaches to their histories, cultural productions, and socioeconomic and political experiences.</p>
<p>As an academic department, Ethnic Studies fosters interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of experts of critical racial and ethnic studies, while serving as teachers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. The Ethnic Studies Department strives to make connections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change, and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. The Ethnic Studies Department serves as a resource for students, faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in examining race and ethnicity and its intersections with multiple modes of inequality including class, gender, citizenship, and nationality.</p>
<p>The department offers students the option to complete a major in ethnic studies (bachelor of science) or a minor in ethnic studies. The major provides students with advanced and concentrated training in racial and ethnic studies with coursework clustered in the upper division around six themes: Community Engagement and Social Movements; Race, Law, Politics, and Policy; Intersectionality and Hybridity; Inequality and Education; Immigration, Transnationalism, and Globalization; and Social and Cultural Analysis. Both the stand alone major and minor enhance a student&apos;s employment opportunities in business, community service work, education, law, medicine, social work, politics, and government. For those considering graduate school, the majors provide a foundation for graduate studies particularly for those who seek to become university professors and researchers with a specialization in a variety of issues and policies impacting racial and ethnic communities.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major">Requirements for the Major</h2>
<p>In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum, students pursuing the major in ethnic studies must complete the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ETHN 5</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two courses from ETHN 10, 20, 30, 40, 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>One of the following breadth electives: ANTH 86, 90; DANC 62; ENGL 35, 35G, 36, 37, 38, 39, 69; ETHN 11, 12, 21, 22, 25, 35, 36, 41, 50, 51, 55, 59, 60, 65, 69, 70, 75, 95, 96; MUSC 20; RSOC 91; THTR 14, 65</p>
</li>
<li><p>Six upper-division courses selected from at least four of the following six categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Community Engagement and Social Movements (ETHN 112, 122, 123, 125,132, 133, 142, 149, 153, 160, 163, 166, 171)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Race, Law, Politics and Policy (ETHN 120, 126, 127, 149, 153, 155, 178, 180 )</p>
</li>
<li><p>Intersectionality and Hybridity (ETHN 121, 129, 141, 151, 152, 154, 157, 163, 167, 169)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inequality and Education (ETHN 150, 157, 161, 167)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Immigration, Transnationalism, and Globalization (ETHN 112, 120, 126, 127, 138, 170, 171, 172, 178, )</p>
</li>
<li><p>Social and Cultural Analysis (ETHN 124, 128, 130, 131, 132, 135, 136, 141, 144, 145, 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 172)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: No class can be used to fulfill more than one category.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An upper-division elective that may be completed within ethnic studies or from any other department or program (with the approval of the department chair)</p>
</li>
<li><p>An upper-division seminar in theory and methods (ETHN 165 or 195)</p>
</li>
<li><p>A capstone project fulfilled through one of two options: (1) completion of ETHN 198, or (2) a research project completed in an upper-division ethnic studies seminar. In the first option, students will complete an applied research project through ETHN 198 that typically encompasses a community internship along with a weekly essay and final paper. In the second option, students will complete a research project that typically entails intensive reading and writing and the execution of a research design or some equivalent project. The capstone provides opportunities for students to apply their understanding of methodology and specific methods to a project explicitly centered around critical racial and ethnic studies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-minor">Requirements for the Minor</h2>
<p>Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in ethnic studies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ETHN 5</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two courses from ETHN 10, 20, 30, 40, 80</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four upper-division courses in ethnic studies (this may include a capstone project that follows the same guidelines as the major capstone project listed above.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: For course descriptions, see the listings of the relevant departments. Students should consult with the Ethnic Studies Department Chair to determine the applicability of courses taken at other institutions or in study abroad programs.</p>

<h3 id="178-race-and-world-war-ii">178. Race and World War II</h3>
<p>World War II stands as one of the most explosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the postwar world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of &quot;race&quot; in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="180-race-voting-campaigns-and-elections">180. Race, Voting, Campaigns, and Elections</h3>
<p>This class examines how the traditional vehicles of American political participation -- namely voting, campaigns, and elections -- have been racialized throughout American history and the particular impacts and responses among African Americans and Latinas/os/xs. As part of this examination we look closely at the participation of racial and ethnic minorities in various forms of electoral activity (as both voters and candidates), we analyze enduring</p>
<p>obstacles to their political empowerment (both structural and resource constraints), and highlight efforts to remove those barriers. A critical examination of the upcoming national elections will feature prominently throughout this course and students will have the opportunity to examine local elections more closely through an original research project designed to study the intersection of race and voting in San Jose, California.

<h3 id="187-seminar---youth-activism--contemporary-social-movements">187. Seminar - Youth Activism &amp; Contemporary Social Movements</h3>
<p>Youth Activism &amp; Contemporary Social Movements examines current social movements catalyzed and led by young people. The course specifically examines youth community organizing and youth activism as a context for social justice work that parallels, yet differs from the Civil Rights Movements of the 1960s. In this course, we engage an intersectional analysis of race, age, and other markers of identity and difference. Through this perspective we will examine the contributions and role of young people in contemporary 21st-century social movements from the 1960s through the present that have contributed to contemporary youth activisms. Within a U.S. context, social movements have often been grouped into three different time periods: the Civil Rights Movement, the post-1960s, and the contemporary social movements. The thematic organization of these periods reflects the different struggles experienced by social groups within societies, and the varied approaches and mechanisms through which communities and young people organized. Although these social movements and waves of political activism are characterized and shaped by the timeframe of their unique sociopolitical context, there are similarities across all periods. One similarity across these times frames concerns the significant leadership and activism of young people&#x2014;children, youth, and young adults&#x2014;to resist and challenge structures of power and systems of oppression. From Anti-Islamophobia movements to Black Lives Matter to Undocumented &amp; Unafraid to LGBTQ and women&#x2019;s rights movements to the institutionalization of ethnic studies curricula and the ending of gun violence in schools&#x2014;all of these movements underscore the power of young people.

<h3 id="188-seminar---civil-rights-and-anti-colonial-movements">188. Seminar - Civil Rights and Anti-Colonial Movements</h3>
<p>This course examines the connections between two historical developments often treated separately: the U.S. civil rights struggle and anti-colonial movements across the globe. By placing these movements in a transnational framework, we will explore through readings and the production of an original research paper, the global challenge to the racialized world order of the modern world. What was the longer history and role of Black Nationalism and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? How did women contribute to the longer struggle against white supremacy in both the United States and colonial world? The central goal of the course is to expand our understanding of anti-racist struggle by moving beyond the formal boundaries of the United States of America in the 20th and 21st centuries.
