<p>The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures educates students to be global citizens prepared to confront the complex challenges of our 21st century&apos;s interdependent world community. Our faculty of professional language educators and scholars integrates the teaching of language and culture throughout our curricula in order to enable students to communicate effectively across cultures; to appreciate cultural diversity; to interpret and discuss words, images, texts, and discourses in their sociocultural context; and to identify and analyze problems across cultural and national boundaries. With rigorous, high-quality programs deeply rooted in our Jesuit values and in the principles of the liberal arts experience, we offer students unique learning experiences, both in and out of the classroom, which enrich their personal lives, help them discern a future career path, and prepare them to compete locally and globally for a wide variety of careers.</p>
<p>The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as degree programs leading to the Bachelor of Arts in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, and Spanish studies. Honors programs are available for French majors. The department offers minors in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, Japanese studies, and Spanish studies. Students can also combine language studies, especially Arabic, Chinese, or German with interdisciplinary minors (e.g., Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern studies; Asian studies; international studies; international business) or an individual studies major, which is offered by the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>
<p>Many modern languages and literatures&apos; courses fulfill Core requirements, including the Core Second Language requirement, Cultures &amp; Ideas (1, 2, 3), Diversity, Civic Engagement, ELSJ, and several Pathways. All courses are open to any student with the requisite preparation. Some of these courses are offered in English as noted in the course descriptions. Courses offered in English do not fulfill the Core Second Language requirement.</p>
<p>Students interested in taking a course in a language they have never previously studied should begin at the Elementary 1 level course. Those who wish to continue studying a language they studied prior to coming to SCU (or grew up speaking at home) must take a Placement Test to determine the most appropriate course for their level. This test is free and can be taken from any location. See the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures&apos; <a href="http://www.scu.edu/modernlanguages" target="_blank">website</a> for more information on placement and proficiency testing. Study abroad is a valuable enhancement of the undergraduate experience and is particularly recommended for students pursuing a major or minor in a foreign language. Both the Global Engagement Office and the student&apos;s modern languages&apos; advisor should be consulted to ensure appropriate integration of the work done abroad into the student&apos;s program of study.</p>
