<p>The Department of Art and Art History offers degree programs leading to the bachelor of arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both disciplines fostering a thorough understanding of the history and practice of art. Department faculty encourage interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara community through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of college and undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements, as well as offering courses through the University Honors Program.</p>
<h2 id="art-history">Art History</h2>
<p>Art history majors at Santa Clara examine the broad range of human visual expression, across space and time, developing understandings of the meanings and purposes of the visual arts, including their historical development, roles in society, and relationships to other fields in the humanities. Students benefit from a program distinguished by excellent teaching and mentoring, challenging coursework, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, and student internships at local and Bay Area institutions. The art history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth that help students learn to think critically and communicate clearly about works of art. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in our annual Art History Symposium and the Art History Research Paper Competition. The art history major develops the following skills: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysis of visual objects and textual sources, advanced research and writing skills, and sophisticated oral presentations. The cultural understanding and intellectual skills developed through the program enable art history majors to pursue a wide variety of interests in a wide spectrum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history.</p>
<h2 id="studio-art">Studio Art</h2>
<p>Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or careers in either the fine or commercial arts. Faculty members emphasize the development of conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student&apos;s own work and that of others. By graduation, every studio art major develops a body of original artwork to be exhibited in a senior show for display in the department gallery space. In conjunction with the senior show, students are required to articulate an artist&apos;s statement reflecting their own engagement with the creative process, in conjunction with their senior show. Studio art majors enjoy opportunities to present their artwork in regional conferences as well as in student-organized exhibitions on and off campus. At the end of each academic year, students are encouraged to submit their work to the Annual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professional in the field of art. The Department also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are awarded to outstanding studio art majors with junior standing.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-majors">Requirements for the Majors</h2>
<p>In addition to fulfilling the undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in art history (ARTH) or studio art (ARTS) must complete the following departmental requirements:</p>
<p><strong>Major in Art History</strong></p>
<p>Students must complete 15 courses (13 ARTH and 2 ARTS):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Four courses from ARTH 11A, 12A, 21--81</p>

<h3 id="26-art-making-china-modern">26. Art! Making China Modern</h3>
<p>On the long march from dynastic regime to global power, art has made China modern on its own terms. In the 19th century writers, politicians, and revolutionaries looked to Japan and Europe to learn how art could renovate the nation. After WWI, leftists weaponized woodcuts and folk arts to combat the forces of Japan and the U.S.-backed Nationalists. At the dawn of the People&apos;s Republic, art reorganized society and fueled radical conformity. As China globalized, artists cashed in on burgeoning markets, grappled with legacies, sounded alarms about oppression, and questioned &quot;The Chinese Dream.&quot; Fulfills the Studio Art program global emphasis course requirement.

<h3 id="66-fabricating-nature-in-east-asia">66. Fabricating Nature in East Asia</h3>
<p>Across East Asia, artists and designers have fabricated landscapes to marshall natural forces for human-centered purposes. In China, visualizing Confucian and Daoist principles through paintings and gardens ordered society and cultivated individuals. In Korea, artists interpreted imported religions and philosophies through indigenous beliefs, giving birth to True View painting and <em>seowon</em> rural campuses. Japan&apos;s native Shinto&#x304; steered Buddhism in new directions, culminating in Zen and <em>roji</em> tea gardens. Today, these religions, philosophies, aesthetics, and practices remain vigorous, exerting themselves in art and landscape design worldwide, offering solutions to environmental challenges, and alternatives to the isolation of modern life.

<h3 id="81-modern-indian-art">81. Modern Indian Art</h3>
<p>This course will take you through a survey of modern Indian art in the 20th century. We will see how Indian artists constantly engaged with and responded to modernity and the modernisms they encountered in the global art world, while working through late-colonial, post-independence and contemporary Indian contexts. Early modern artists of the Bengal School of art grappled with the question of how to be &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;Indian&quot; in their search for an &quot;Indian-ness&quot; devoid of Western elements, while post-independence artists of the Progressive Artists Group could freely work with both Western modernism and Indian idioms toward self-expression. We will see how this trajectory moves into contemporary art and also contextualize feminism by reading about the works of women artists from varied backgrounds.

<h3 id="120-keeping-up-with-the-medici-fame-and-family-in-renaissance-florence">120. Keeping up with the Medici: Fame and Family in Renaissance Florence</h3>
<p>What makes someone a &quot;household name&quot;? Is it talent, beauty, connections, or simply shrewd marketing? While fame, fortune, and celebrity may seem like modern phenomena, the cult of personality was equally prominent in Renaissance Florence. As is the case today, money played a key role in the arts. This course focuses on the ways in which the Medici family, through their social, financial, and spiritual support, transformed the city of Florence from an Italian commune with limited natural resources into the center of the European culture. And in doing so, transformed the notion of the artist from that of mere craftsman to superstar. Additional topics of discussion include the influence of the capitalist economics on artistic production, domestic art perceptions of the nude figure in religious paintings, the relationship between art and science, and the writings of Machiavelli. (5 units)</p>

(5 units)</p>
<h3 id="123-the-global-renaissance">123. The Global Renaissance</h3>
<p>The &quot;Renaissance&quot; has traditionally been viewed as a period of artistic and cultural development associated almost exclusively with the Italian peninsula in the 15th and 16th century. This same tradition privileges &quot;high art&quot;---that is, painting, sculpture, and architecture over other forms of visual culture. This course seeks to reassess these notions by considering Italian Renaissance art within the context of early modern globalism. This reexamination likewise mandates a consideration of a broader spectrum of objects, including gemstones, glassware, and textiles. Topics such as the relationship between Michelangelo, Leonardo, and the Ottoman architect Sinan, the collection of Aztec feather paintings by the Medici family, and the influence of Egyptian mosque architecture on Venetian palace design will be examined from an interdisciplinary perspective.

<h3 id="166-from-emaki-to-manga">166. From Emaki to Manga</h3>
<p>For over a millennium, Japanese artists have used pictorial narratives to circulate ideas and explore emotions. Buddhist Jataka tales inspired devotion, while emaki handscrolls explored romantic longing concealed beneath courtly protocols. Explicit and grotesque visions of hell admonished men and women for separate sins. As Japan modernized, prints and manga celebrated urbanism and imperialism, and bore witness to atrocities. Inherent in these ancient and contemporary narratives are changing definitions of gender as artists have negotiated and challenged the dynamics between male and female authors and subjects, as well as universal themes and indigenous aesthetics.
