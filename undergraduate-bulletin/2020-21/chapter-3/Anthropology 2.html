<p><em>Professor Emeritus</em>: George Westermark</p>
<p><em>Dean&apos;s Executive Professor:</em> James J. McKenna</p>
<p><em>Professors</em>: Michelle Bezanson, Lisa Kealhofer</p>
<p><em>Associate Professors</em>: Robin Nelson, Lee Panich (Department Chair)</p>

<p>The Department of Anthropology offers a degree program leading to a bachelor of science in anthropology. A solid undergraduate foundation in anthropology secures the analytical skills needed to undertake professional degrees in anthropology, business, law, public health, social services, or provides a foundation for embarking on a number of other professional careers. The department also offers a minor, several emphases, and an honors thesis option.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major">Requirements for the Major</h2>
<p>In addition to fulfilling the undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students majoring in anthropology must complete the following departmental requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ANTH 1</p>
</li>
<li><p>ANTH 2</p>
</li>
<li><p>ANTH 3</p>
</li>
<li><p>ANTH 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8</p>
</li>
<li><p>ANTH/ENVS 50</p>
</li>
<li><p>ANTH 110</p>
</li>
<li><p>One of the following statistics courses: MATH 8, BIO 160/ENVS 110, PSYC 105, POLI 101</p>
</li>
<li><p>One of the following Methods 1 courses: ANTH 111, 112, 113</p>
</li>
<li><p>One of the following Methods 2 courses: ENVS 116/116a, PSYC 105, BIO 160/ENVS 110 (in addition to MATH 8), or an additional ANTH Methods I class</p>
</li>
<li><p>ANTH 114</p>
</li>
<li><p>ANTH 198</p>
</li>
<li><p>Six upper-division courses selected from the following three categories (all three categories must be represented):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Archaeology (ANTH 140--149, 173, 186, 189)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Biological Anthropology (ANTH 130--139)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cultural Anthropology (ANTH 150--179, 184, 185, 187, 188)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Attending six Anthropology Seminars is required for majors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="emphasis-programs-in-anthropology">Emphasis Programs in Anthropology</h3>
<p>Anthropology majors have the option of completing a special emphasis program to complement their majors. The emphasis is not a narrow specialization but reflects competence in the subfields of the discipline. Completion of a special emphasis program will be noted on student transcripts with the approval of the department chair.</p>
<p>The emphasis in applied anthropology prepares students to use anthropological knowledge to address critical human issues in careers outside academia. Through coursework and related internships, students will gain a better understanding of how anthropological knowledge and skills can be used in occupations related to health and medicine, international development, environment, government, business, education, immigration, and poverty. The emphasis in archaeology focuses on a deeper understanding of the human past and how it is studied. This is a possible course of study for majors with an interest in employment in cultural resource management or graduate study in archaeology. The biological emphasis provides in-depth training in the field of biological anthropology. Students will acquire intellectual breadth and depth with regard to the interdisciplinary nature of anthropology and the biological and cultural interactions that have influenced human evolution and modern human diversity.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-minor">Requirements for the Minor</h2>
<p>Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in anthropology:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ANTH 1 or 2</p>
</li>
<li><p>ANTH 3</p>
</li>
<li><p>One additional lower-division anthropology course</p>
</li>
<li><p>ANTH 110</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two approved upper-division anthropology courses</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four anthropology seminars</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lower-division-courses">Lower-Division Courses</h2>
<h3 id="1-introduction-to-biological-anthropology">1. Introduction to Biological Anthropology</h3>
<p>Using an evolutionary framework, we examine how past and current human variation is measured, our place in nature, human genetics, human and nonhuman primate biology and behavior, the primate and hominin fossil record, and the origin and meaning of human biological and behavioral variation. Students gain experience in biological anthropology methods, data analysis and interpretation, and the theoretical frameworks that guide our understanding of what it means to be human. Laboratory 15 hours. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="2-introduction-to-archaeology">2. Introduction to Archaeology</h3>
<p>How do archaeologists understand the past? This course examines the methods, theories, and analytical techniques that archaeologists use to study the past and interpret ancient cultures. Selective survey of human cultures over time in different regions of the world. Laboratory 15 hours. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="3-introduction-cultural-anthropology">3. Introduction Cultural Anthropology</h3>
<p>This course provides an introduction to the subject matter, research methods, and applications of cultural anthropology. Its purpose is to help students understand how different human groups think and live, how they cope with life&apos;s demands and expectations, and how they make sense of the world. In order to gain additional experience with diverse cultural groups, students are required to participate in off-campus Arrupe partnerships. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="4-vanished-peoples-and-lost-civilizations">4. Vanished Peoples and Lost Civilizations</h3>
<p>&quot;Popular archaeology&quot; is addressed by examining past societies, human migrations and cultural contacts, and ancient human behavior and technologies. Ideas and assumptions found in movies and other popular media will be evaluated in light of current archaeological data and theory. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="5-popular-culture-and-bioanthropology">5. Popular Culture and Bioanthropology</h3>
<p>From <em>King Kong</em> to <em>Clan of the Cave Bear</em>, students examine popular culture interpretations of biological anthropology. After reviewing the history of biological anthropology, we analyze popular avenues (film, cartoons, newspapers, fiction) through which the public has been informed about human variation, the human fossil record, primate behavior, and human genetics. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="6-screen-time-culture-film-and-media-in-the-21st-century">6. Screen Time: Culture, Film, and Media in the 21st Century</h3>
<p>This course uses anthropological perspectives and methods to explore how popular media shapes, creates, and transforms our understanding of culture, identity, and social relationships in the 21st century. This course is not just about culture, difference, and identity, but also about how we learn about and intersect with cultural and identity formation processes through various forms of media. Throughout the course we will use feature-length films as starting points for thinking critically about culture, gender, class, race/racism, economics, ideology, family, kinship, and violence. We will also be critically discussing how film and media shape our perceptions and understandings of the complex, global, and highly socially mediated world in which we live. One of the core premises of this course, following Bird and Godwin (2006), is that we cannot simply assume that media &quot;speaks for itself.&quot; Building upon the work of cultural and media anthropologists, and the late Neil Postman, the primary goal of this course is to push students to take a more active, and anthropologically informed, approach to the highly mediated world in which we live. (4 units)</p>

<h3 id="8-humankind-unplugged">8. Humankind Unplugged</h3>
<p>In this course we explore the evolution of human behavior and its underlying anatomical and physiological bases, all from a distinctly anthropological (which is to say, holistic and comparative) perspective. We use an integrated multidisciplinary perspective, incorporating any and all relevant information from all the subfields of anthropology involving archaeology (prehistory and history), paleoanthropology, cross-cultural ethnographic and cross-species data, and sociolinguistics, in addition to material that incorporates research from developmental psychobiology and social psychology, history, sociology, as well as from human biology. We explore in detail why humans give birth to the most neurologically underdeveloped infant of all and, relatedly, why we find them irresistible and want to hold and protect them, and why we are the only mammal infant born with about 9 percent of fat on our bodies, all quite naturally. We examine how humans really made it, alive, throughout human evolution and how the Homo species came to distinguish itself throughout the worldwide ice age. (4 units)</p>
