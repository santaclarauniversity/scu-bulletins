<p>The Department of Political Science offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of science in political science. The department introduces students to the analysis of political behavior, values, institutions, and governments. It also offers preparation for various graduate and professional studies and for careers in public service, education, and the private sector.</p>
<p>The department offers opportunities to participate in a variety of programs that combine practical field experience and academic credit. It assists students in arranging academic credit for internships. Placements include government agencies, legislative or judicial bodies, political parties, and nongovernment organizations. On the national level, Santa Clara partners with American University&apos;s Washington, D.C., program, in which students receive credit for internships and intensive seminars in the nation&apos;s Capitol. Santa Clara also participates in the Panetta Institute&apos;s Congressional Internship Program, which fully subsidizes students who study and intern with the California Congressional delegation on Capitol Hill. On the international level, the department encourages student participation in the numerous University-operated and approved study abroad programs around the world.</p>

<p>The international relations emphasis allows students to focus on the international system and the interaction of national and non-national actors on the global stage. Sample topics addressed by the international relations emphasis include international organizations; transnational movements; conflict resolution, peace, and reconciliation; military-strategic issues; international political economy; human rights; development and economic justice; and global sustainability.</p>
<p>Requirements for the international relations emphasis include a variety of courses both inside and outside of the political science department. For the most up-to-date information about the international relations emphasis, please contact the emphasis advisor.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Senior seminar: POLI 196 (International Relations) or POLI 192 (Comparative Politics)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Three upper-division international relations courses : POLI 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 131;or 116A and 116B combined.</p>
</li>
<li><p>One international relations-related course outside the political science department: ECON 3, 129, 137, 181, 182; ENVS 147; HIST 105, 116S, 121, 131, 141, 142, 144S, 151, 163; TESP 159; SOCI 133, 134; or other courses as approved by the program director.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Emphasis in Pre-Law</strong></p>
<p>Political science is one of the most common majors for pre-law students. After all, political science is the closest of all majors to the institutions and values with which law deals. The primary study of law is the state, and so too for political science. Additionally, the demands of political science courses (reading of complex texts, independent research, frequent class presentations, and demanding writing assignments) strengthen the analytical and communications skills that the practice of law requires.</p>
<p>Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include a variety of courses from both inside and outside of the political science department. At most, six courses are required: three within the political science department and three from outside the political science department, although many of these courses fulfill other Core and political science major requirements. For the most up-to-date information about the pre-law emphasis and specific courses, please contact the emphasis advisor.</p>
