<p>The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science offers major programs leading to the bachelor of science in mathematics or the bachelor of science in computer science, as well as required and elective courses for students majoring in other fields. Either major may be pursued with any of three principal goals: preparation for graduate studies leading to advanced degrees in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science, statistics, operations research, or other fields; preparation for secondary school teaching of mathematics or computer science; or preparation for a research career in business, industry, or government. The major in mathematics may be taken with an emphasis in applied mathematics, financial mathematics, mathematical economics, or mathematics education. The emphasis in mathematics education is designed to prepare majors to take the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET). The major in computer science offers emphases specializing in algorithms and complexity, data science, security, software, or one of the student&apos;s choosing. Minors in mathematics or computer science are also available.</p>
<p>The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science maintains a program for the discovery, encouragement, and development of talent in mathematics or computer science among undergraduates. This program includes special sections, seminars, individual conferences, and directed study guided by selected faculty members. Students are also encouraged to participate actively in research projects directed by faculty.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major">Requirements for the Major</h2>

<h2 id="preparation-in-mathematics-for-admission-to-teacher-training-credential-programs">Preparation in Mathematics for Admission to Teacher Training Credential Programs</h2>
<p>The State of California requires that students seeking a credential to teach mathematics or computer science in California secondary schools must pass the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET), a subject area competency examination. The secondary teaching credential additionally requires the completion of an approved credential program, which can be completed as a fifth year of study and student teaching, or through an undergraduate summer program internship. Students who are contemplating secondary school teaching in mathematics or computer science should consult with the coordinator in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science as early as possible.</p>
