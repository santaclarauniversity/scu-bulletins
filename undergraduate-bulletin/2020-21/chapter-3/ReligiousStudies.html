<p>The Department of Religious Studies offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of arts in religious studies. The department also offers a minor program for those who wish to concentrate in theological and religious studies. In keeping with the University&apos;s commitment to the Catholic faith tradition, the department offers a variety of courses in Scripture, history, and Catholic theology. Faithful to the Jesuit tradition of liberal education and engagement with other religions, the department offers a wide breadth of courses in various religious traditions and methodologies for the study of religion. The department also offers courses as part of the undergraduate Core Curriculum, at both lower-division and upper-division levels. Courses are clustered in three areas: Theology, Ethics, and Spirituality (TESP); Scripture and Tradition (SCTR); and Religion and Society (RSOC).</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major">Requirements for the Major</h2>
<p>In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in religious studies must complete the following departmental requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Three lower-division courses, one from each of the three areas (scripture and tradition; theology, ethics, and spirituality; and religion and society)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seven approved upper-division courses, including three designated religious studies seminars, with one in each of the three areas</p>
</li>
<li><p>RELS 90 (Theories and Methods)</p>
</li>
<li><p>RELS 197A and RELS 197B, a two quarter capstone seminar</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-minor">Requirements for the Minor</h2>
<p>Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in religious studies:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="lower-division-courses-scripture-and-tradition-sctr">Lower-Division Courses: Scripture and Tradition (SCTR)</h2>
<h3 id="15-texting-god">15. Texting God</h3>
<p>This course explores how people express their beliefs and how the technologies they use shape what they say. Focusing on Jewish and Christian &quot;texts&quot; (oral, written, visual, gesture), we&apos;ll examine the core beliefs that communities inscribe in them. We&apos;ll also consider how scriptural memes are reconstructed in the ongoing process of building cultural memory. We&apos;ll learn to analyze the rhetoric of various modes, and ask how changing technologies are altering our experience of text, scripture, and our relationships with God. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="19-religions-of-the-book">19. Religions of the Book</h3>
<p>This course offers an introduction to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam with a study of their central texts, traditions and practices. We begin the course with a paradox: religion, that which in its literal sense &quot;binds&quot; or &quot;fastens together,&quot; is also that which often violently divides our world. As we examine the sacred texts of Jews, Christians, and Muslims (Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran), and various methods of interpreting them, our focus will remain on what is shared and what characteristically distinguishes between the monotheistic faiths. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="26-gender-in-early-christianity">26. Gender in Early Christianity</h3>
<p>The history of early Christianity is often portrayed as a history of, by, and about men, despite clear indications that women played a prominent role in the early church. Introduces the construction of gender in antiquity, Jewish and Greco-Roman laws and customs, the biblical canon, and other Christian texts. Contemporary feminist perspectives will inform the discussion. Also listed as WGST 46. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="27-digging-up-jesus">27. Digging Up Jesus</h3>
<p>This course examines the archaeological and literary evidence for Jesus. We&apos;ll use these primary &quot;texts&quot; to reconstruct the most plausible context for Jesus&apos; work so that we can better understand the Gospel message, and learn the criteria for assessing whether he really said and did what the Gospels report. We&apos;ll also try to appreciate what the Gospel authors were doing in translating Jesus for their communities, just as we are doing ourselves with the historical approach of the course. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="28-women-in-the-hebrew-bible">28. Women In the Hebrew Bible</h3>
<p>This course explores stores, tropes, metaphors, poetry, and archaeology related to Hebrew Bible and Old Testament (HB/OT) women. Biblical studies methodologies and interdisciplinary lenses will be used to create access points with the material culture of the Ancient Near East (ANE), literary life and afterlives of biblical texts, as well as intersectional juxtapositions between ANE and contemporary lives of women. We will explore questions such as: Did God have a wife? Are the oldest parts of the HB/OT written by women? How many different ways can families be defined? How does the HB/OT promote leadership and women? Also listed as WGST 21. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="33-new-testament-narratives-and-cinema">33. New Testament Narratives and Cinema</h3>
<p>Exploration of the stories that emerged with the Jesus event, their historicity, and their role in forming the early Christian communities. No previous knowledge of Christianity is needed. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="39-biblical-women-and-power">39. Biblical Women and Power</h3>
<p>Hero, villain, prophet, deviant---these are some of the power roles embodied by women in the Bible. Explores the exercise of power by biblical women in actual and figurative situations, in culturally positive and negative ways. Attention will be given to the continuing impact of such traditions for gender socialization in our world today. Also listed as WGST 47. (4 units)</p>
<h3 id="48-racializing-jesus">48. Racializing Jesus</h3>
<p>The course explores the various ancient and contemporary ethnic representations of Jesus in art, film, regalia, and scripture. Although portraits of Jesus as a white, blue-eyed prophet, messiah, or rabbi haunt the popular cultural imagination, these often reflect the social location and racial biases of Western scholars. But, what if Jesus was black, non-white Latinx, Amerindian, Asian, or Jewish? And, why is contemporary scholarship still grappling with the idea of Jewish messiah? In order to map the politics of interpretation and presentation, the course seeks to &quot;radicalize&quot; Jesus by (1) exploring his Jewishness in terms of race and ethnicity; (2) critically engaging sources from the New Testament, Apocryphal narratives, Rabbinic literature, and the Quran; (3) interrogation of the racial/racist reconstructions of Western biblical scholarship; and (4) mapping the implications for marginalized ethnic communities and interracial dialogue. Key themes to explore include: race/ethnicity, colonialism and imperialism, the quests for historical Jesus, Hitler&apos;s Third Reich, eugenics, interreligious dialogue, police violence (Ferguson &amp; Baltimore), and the polemic over Jesus&apos; wife.

Most centrally, the question arises: what is the relationship between good, especially God, and evil? Should we hope? Can we? Is hell stronger than heaven? Does fire burn hotter than love?

<h3 id="135-theological-anthropology-and-artificial-intelligence">135. Theological Anthropology and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>This course will explore the developing field of artificial intelligence (AI) by placing it into conversation with a speculative reading of theological anthropology. Theological anthropology argues that human nature must be understood in relationship with the transcendent. An exemplar of this approach, Hans Urs von Balthasar explores how a relationships with the transcendent influences our use of logic and our understanding of truth. Balthasar argues that logic and truth operate in the four areas of: (1) nature, (2) freedom, (3) mystery, and (4) participation. Is machine intelligence possible without incorporating these themes into its programming? By aligning the machine to each of these four broad concerns, will the machine then become not only self-conscious, but also, aware of the existence of a transcendent being? Can an adequately complex algorithm and comprehensive logic engine create the equivalent of a machine soul? (5 units)</p>

This course examines several contemporary social issues using the lenses of Christian theology and ethics, with a particular emphasis on Catholic Social Teaching. We will examine themes such as human dignity and human rights, the common good, economic justice, sin, solidarity, and a preferential option for the poor. In light of these themes, the course invites students to assess responses to various social topics, such as U.S. immigration, racism and civil rights, capital punishment, and state-sanctioned medically-assisted death.
