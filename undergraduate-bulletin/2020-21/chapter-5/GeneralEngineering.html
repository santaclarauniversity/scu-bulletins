<p><em>Director of General Engineering</em>: Jessica Kuczenski</p>
<p><em>Lecturers</em>: Jessica Kuczenski, Matthew Gaudet</p>
<p>The School of Engineering, under the leadership of the director of general engineering, offers a major in general engineering, a minor in general engineering, and a minor in technical innovation, design thinking, and the entrepreneurial mindset. The bachelor of science degree in general engineering is designed to provide students a technical degree with concentrations designed to meet the needs of the individual student. Not intended for a student who plans to work as a professional engineer, the general engineering degree allows a student to earn a technical degree while preparing for work or graduate study in fields such as law, medicine, business, or education.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major">Requirements for the Major</h2>
<p>In addition to fulfilling the undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree in engineering, students majoring in engineering must complete the minimum number of units and the specified requirements for their concentration.</p>
<p>Students majoring in engineering must complete a minimum of 189 units and the following requirements:</p>

<h2 id="minor-in-technical-innovation-design-thinking-and-the-entrepreneurial-mindset">Minor in Technical Innovation, Design Thinking, and the Entrepreneurial Mindset</h2>
<p><em>Program Coordinator:</em> Christopher Kitts</p>
<p>To solve the complex and interdisciplinary technical challenges of the modern world, students must understand the entrepreneurial methods appropriate for harnessing technical innovation in order to create value through new devices, products, systems, processes, services, and ecosystems. This minor addresses this need by providing students with learning experiences that address product innovation, business fundamentals, and entrepreneurial thinking; in doing so, it leverages themes and concepts promoted through movements such as design thinking, lean development, and business modeling. In addition, an experiential learning activity in the context of the entrepreneurial development of a real engineering system is required. Participation in an elective component is also required.</p>
<p>This minor program is suitable for undergraduates in a wide variety of disciplines. It places an emphasis on an understanding of the user and the business environment for the design and implementation of technologies and solutions that are appropriate, affordable, and accessible for consumers in a variety of markets. Students who complete the program will be able to adapt both themselves and the organizations in which they work in a way that will allow them to remain competitive and relevant as global consumer trends continue to evolve.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-minor-in-technical-innovation-design-thinking-and-the-entrepreneurial-mindset">Requirements for the Minor in Technical Innovation, Design Thinking, and the Entrepreneurial Mindset</h2>
<p>The minor includes requirements in the areas of Product Innovation and Prototyping, Business and Commercialization, and Design Thinking and Entrepreneurial Fundamentals. Students are also required to complete an experiential project putting these concepts into practice as well as participation in two elective activities. Multiple options are available for each of these requirements, affording students a great deal of flexibility in completing the minor.</p>
<p>Currently, the Minor offers an optional BioInnovation and Design track to provide students with an opportunity to focus their study of innovation and design/entrepreneurial thinking to medical and health care applications.</p>
