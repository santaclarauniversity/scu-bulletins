<p>Bioengineering is the fastest-growing segment of engineering today and holds the promise of improving the lives of all people in very direct and diverse ways. Bioengineering focuses on the application of biological, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and other engineering principles to understand, modify, or control biological systems, and educates students to solve problems at the interface of engineering and the life sciences.</p>
<p>The major in bioengineering is designed to prepare students for careers in the medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, graduate study in bioengineering, or entry into medical school.</p>
<p>The bioengineering (or biomedical engineering) minor is primarily designed for those students who are interested in the field but are majoring in other disciplines, particularly science majors, students completing prerequisites for medical school as part of their undergraduate degree, or engineering majors.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major">Requirements for the Major</h2>

<p>The Department of Bioengineering offers a combined degree program leading to a bachelor of science and a master of science. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master&apos;s degree before completing the requirements for a bachelor&apos;s degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science in bioengineering within a year of completing the bachelor&apos;s degree.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students admitted to the combined degree program are required to enroll in the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor&apos;s degree after satisfying the standard undergraduate degree requirements. To earn a master&apos;s degree, students must fulfill all requirements for the degree, including the completion of 46 units of coursework beyond that applied to the bachelor&apos;s degree. The program of studies for the master&apos;s degree may include up to 20 units taken while enrolled as an undergraduate student; however, no individual course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor&apos;s degree and master&apos;s degree.</p>
