<p>Civil engineers are responsible for planning, designing, building, maintaining, and rehabilitating the complex interrelated technological, social, and environmental dimension of the infrastructure systems on which modern society relies. To meet these challenges, the Department of Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering offers a well-balanced undergraduate program that develops graduates capable of solving complex problems with fixed and often limited resources. The application of state-of-the-art skills, a sound understanding of engineering principles, concepts of sustainability and resilience in design, the ability to communicate and articulate ideas, and preparation for lifelong learning are some of the key areas of focus in the civil, environmental and sustainable engineering curriculum. At the completion of the undergraduate program, graduates are well equipped to enter the practice or pursue advanced studies in any of the civil engineering disciplines. The department provides students with the necessary guidance to develop their full potential within the context of their own personal experiences, the expectations of the profession, and societal needs. Our graduates become civil engineers with primary responsibility for planning, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining infrastructure critical to public welfare, safety, and the expectations of daily life---including buildings, transportation systems, airports, irrigation systems, water supplies, supply systems, and environmental protection facilities.</p>
<p>The Department of Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering works with its advisory board and other key constituencies to produce the program&apos;s educational objectives shown below. Specifically, the department has committed itself to providing a program that produces graduates who, within five years of graduation, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Capable of designing, building, maintaining, or improving civil infrastructure systems in the context of environmental, economic, and societal requirements</p>
</li>
<li><p>Serving the community as ethical and responsible professionals</p>
</li>
<li><p>Engaging in lifelong learning for professional growth</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major-in-civil-engineering">Requirements for the Major in Civil Engineering</h2>
<p>In addition to fulfilling the undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree in Civil Engineering, students must complete a minimum of 195 units and the following department requirements:</p>
<p><strong>English</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ENGL 181</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mathematics and Natural Science</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>MATH 11, 12, 13, 14</p>
</li>
<li><p>AMTH 106 (or MATH 22) and AMTH 112 (or AMTH 108)</p>
</li>
<li><p>CHEM 11 or CHEM 11T</p>
</li>
<li><p>PHYS 31, 32, 33</p>
</li>
<li><p>CENG 20, 20L</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>ENGR 1, 1L</p>
</li>
<li><p>ELEN 49 (or ELEN 50, 50L)</p>
</li>
<li><p>CENG 7, 7L, 10, 10L, 15, 41, 44A, 44AL, 44B, 115, 115L, 121A, 121AL, 121B, 125, 125L, 128, 132, 140, 140L, 141, 141L, 143, 143L, 145, 148, 148L, 192A, 192B, 192C, 193, 194, and either 160 or 182</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Electives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Four technical electives from those listed below, with at least two design-focused electives and at least one analysis-focused elective:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Design-focused electives: CENG 119, 133, 134, 135 &amp; 135L, 136, 137, 138, 142, 144 &amp; 144L, 146, 147, 150</p>
</li>
<li><p>Analysis-focused electives: CENG 118, 123 &amp; 123L, 124, 139, 149, 151, 160, 161, 162, 163, 182, 184, 186 &amp; 186L, 187 &amp; 187L</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>One free elective (4 units)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The technical electives should be selected in consultation with an academic advisor to satisfy the requirements of the general civil, environmental and sustainable engineering program or one of the approved emphasis area programs in civil engineering. The program requires that students take either CENG 160 or CENG 182; whichever course is not taken to satisfy this requirement may be taken as a technical elective.</p>
<h2 id="combined-bachelor-of-science-and-master-of-science-program">Combined Bachelor of Science and Master of Science Program</h2>
<p>The Department of Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering offers a combined degree program leading to a bachelor of science and a master of science. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master&apos;s degree before completing the requirements for a bachelor&apos;s degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science in civil engineering within a year of completing the bachelor&apos;s degree.</p>
<p>Undergraduate students admitted to the combined degree program are required to enroll in the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor&apos;s degree after satisfying the standard undergraduate degree requirements. To earn a master&apos;s degree, students must fulfill all requirements for the degree, including the completion of 46 units of coursework beyond that applied to the bachelor&apos;s degree. The program of studies for the master&apos;s degree may include up to 20 units taken while enrolled as an undergraduate student; however, no individual course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor&apos;s degree and master&apos;s degree.</p>
<h2 id="civil-environmental-and-sustainable-engineering-laboratories">Civil, Environmental and Sustainable Engineering Laboratories</h2>
