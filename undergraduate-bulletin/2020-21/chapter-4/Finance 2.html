<p>Finance is at the center of well-managed businesses, from high technology companies to mutual fund companies. Development of knowledge and managerial skills in the corporate and investment settings are the major goals of the finance program. Graduates with a degree in finance pursue careers as corporate financial officers, traders, investment managers, financial analysts, financial planners, investment bankers, stockbrokers, regulators, and other specialties. Corporate finance officers manage the assets and value of corporations. They examine which new products and investments will be profitable, analyze the most cost-effective ways to produce them, and determine where to get the money needed to fund new ventures. Personal financial planners and stockbrokers help people make wise investments by selecting good stocks and assembling efficient portfolios. Students in finance also learn how to understand and analyze information from capital markets, engage in mergers and acquisitions, and undertake investments in new ventures, real estate, and international markets.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-major">Requirements for the Major</h2>
<p>In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum and Leavey School of Business requirements for the bachelor of science in commerce degree, students majoring in finance must complete the following departmental requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>FNCE 124 and 125</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four upper-division finance electives*</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Note: FNCE 118, FNCE 127, and FNCE 129 will NOT meet upper-division elective requirements for finance majors.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-for-the-real-estate-minor">Requirements for the Real Estate Minor</h2>
<p>All Santa Clara University students may pursue the real estate minor by fulfilling the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>FNCE 118*</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four courses from the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li>FNCE 127*, FNCE 128, FNCE 129*, FNCE 143, ECON 156, and ENVS 128</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Nonbusiness students also need to take at least three additional courses (prerequisites for finance real estate electives): FNCE 121, ACTG 11, and BUSN 70 or BUSN 170.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Note: FNCE 118, FNCE 127, and FNCE 129 will NOT meet upper-division elective requirements for finance majors, and will not be included in the finance major GPA.</p>
<h2 id="upper-division-courses">Upper-Division Courses</h2>
<h3 id="115-quantitative-methods-for-finance">115. Quantitative Methods for Finance</h3>
<p>The goal of this course is to teach finance majors the most important quantitative tools they will need for the finance curriculum. Students will learn to (1) comprehend important concepts, techniques, and tools used in mathematics and statistics that are relevant for modern finance; (2) understand where these tools are applied in practice; and (3) learn widely-used software to implement these techniques. The course goal is to make sure that all finance majors reach a baseline level of competence in various quantitative methods, and is especially intended for those students who fear math, yet have a desire to come to grips with it. A previous math course (e.g., MATH 31 or the MATH 11 and 12 sequence) is strongly recommended. Prerequisite: FNCE 121. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="116-mathematical-finance">116. Mathematical Finance</h3>
<p>Introduction to Ito calculus and stochastic differential equations; discrete lattice models; models for the movement of stock and bond prices using Brownian motion and Poisson processes; pricing models for equity and bond options via Black-Scholes and its variants; optimal portfolio allocation. Solution techniques will include Monte Carlo and finite difference methods. Prerequisites: Either FNCE 115 or MATH 122 or AMTH 108. MATH 53 or permission of the instructor is required if FNCE 115 has not been taken. Cross-listed with MATH 125 and AMTH 367. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="118-real-estate-principles">118. Real Estate Principles</h3>
<p>A foundational course that provides students with a general overview of real estate and practical applications of the material. The course covers a broad range of topics including the historical and legal basis of regulations and customs that govern real estate today, real estate service industries, real estate market analysis, the principles in real estate transactions, and the unique characteristics of real estate as an investment asset class. The course will lay a solid foundation for students to pursue specific areas in greater depth through more focused courses in the future. This course does not satisfy an upper-division elective for finance majors and is not included when calculating the finance major GPA. Prerequisites: 88+ units (junior/senior standing) or ACTG 11. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="121-financial-management">121. Financial Management</h3>
<p>Introduction to the basic concepts of financial risk and return, the valuation of uncertain future cash flows, working capital and fixed asset management, and cost of capital. Topics include time value of money, financial analysis and forecasting, valuing corporate securities (stocks and bonds), capital budgeting, short- and long-term financing, and cash management. Prerequisites: OMIS 40, ACTG 11 and proficiency with spreadsheets. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="121s-financial-management">121S. Financial Management</h3>
<p>Introduction to the basic concepts of financial risk and return, the valuation of uncertain future cash flows, working capital and fixed asset management, and cost of capital. Topics include time value of money, financial analysis and forecasting, valuing corporate securities (stocks and bonds), capital budgeting, short- and long-term financing, and cash management. Prerequisites: Restricted to students in the Leavey Scholars Program. OMIS 40, ACTG 11, and proficiency with spreadsheets. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="124-investments">124. Investments</h3>
<p>Introduction to the nature and functions of securities markets and financial instruments. The formulation of investment goals and policies, trading strategies, and portfolio management.

<h3 id="125-corporate-financial-policy">125. Corporate Financial Policy</h3>
<p>In-depth examination of the interrelationships between corporate investment and financing decisions and their impact on a firm&apos;s pattern of cash flows, return, and risk. Special emphasis on the development of analytical techniques and skills for analyzing performance reflected in financial statements. Case studies are used. Prerequisites: FNCE 121 or 121S, and FNCE 124. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="126-money-and-capital-markets">126. Money and Capital Markets</h3>
<p>Examines the role and function of financial institutions, financial flows, and interest rate structures in the money and capital markets. Viewed primarily from the perspective of a corporate issuer, explores the mechanisms by which value is created by financial markets, the roles of players in the system, the securities in each market, the flows of information, and the design and incentive features that manage risk in a practical manner. Common themes and concepts will be developed by the exploration of a new market in each class, examining a corporate issuer&apos;s funding alternatives, and incorporating current news events.
