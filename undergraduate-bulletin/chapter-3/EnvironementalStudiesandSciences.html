<p>The Department of Environmental Studies and Sciences (ESS) offers interdisciplinary programs of study leading to a bachelor of science in environmental science or environmental studies. A minor in environmental studies is also available. These programs provide students with the intellectual foundation they will need in addressing crucial environmental challenges of the 21st century such as human population growth, urban development, food and agricultural systems, deforestation, global climate change, waste disposal, air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity, and the need for renewable energy.</p>
<p>ESS programs are enriched by colloquia featuring presentations on environmental topics by scholars and practitioners. Majors in ESS are expected to apply their knowledge outside the classroom by completing an approved internship or research experience. During their senior year, ESS students conduct research or an interdisciplinary group project with community stakeholders in ENVS 101 (Capstone Seminar).</p>
<p>ESS students are encouraged to study abroad. Courses such as ENVS 144 (Natural History of Baja L&amp;L) include one week of immersion travel during University academic year breaks. Some summer and academic year courses taken through approved study abroad programs will count toward the requirements of the ESS majors and minors.</p>
<p>Each student works with a faculty advisor, who helps integrate the classroom curriculum with the student&apos;s plans for future study and/or work in environmental fields.</p>
