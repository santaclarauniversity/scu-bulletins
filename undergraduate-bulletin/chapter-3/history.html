Human Rights and Humanitarianism</strong></span></h3><p><span>From reading current news articles, one might surmise that the dignity of human beings and their inherent right of freedom from undue suffering are self-evident, universally acknowledged goods that we should all pursue regardless of culture, place, or time. In fact, however, contemporary ideas about human rights, as well as humanitarian efforts, (often pursued in far distant locales) have a particular history, one rooted in Western Enlightenment-era ideals of individual liberty and the brutal experiences of European imperialism. In this class, we will examine the histories and ideologies of human rights and humanitarianism; consider their underlying assumptions and power dynamics; and investigate the ways these histories relate to current legal, political, and humanitarian organizations and movements. (4 units)</span></p><h3 id="h.mszcvy6py5hj"><span><strong>24. History of Sexually Transmitted Diseases</strong></span></h3><p><span>This course will survey the impact of sexually transmitted infections in a variety of national contexts, from the early modern period to recent times. The focus is mainly upon the history of classic venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea as well as more recently HIV/AIDS. How have medical debates about sexual contagion both influenced and been influenced by cultural conventions of blame, stigma, and moral judgment? Do representations of STDs provide a window into how a society organizes gendered expectations and constructs an image of deviant sexuality? How have responses to the problem of STDs changed over time? Can we examine these changes to better understand broader cultural adjustments to issues as diverse as prostitution and promiscuity, medical treatment and prophylaxis, and the politics of feminism, gay rights, and patients rights. Also listed as HIST 124. (4 units)</span></p><p><span></span></p><a id="id.fax5fpmbinmv"></a><h3 id="h.ynel3qumgn2c"><span><strong>43. The Haitian Revolution in World History </strong></span></h3><p><span>Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the “age of democratic revolutions.” This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island. This course will examine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, its near erasure from Western historical memory, and the literary and historical recovery of its importance in the 20th and 21st centuries.

In fact, however, contemporary ideas about human rights, as well as humanitarian efforts (often pursued in far distant locales), have a particular history, one rooted in Western Enlightenment-era ideals of individual liberty and the brutal experiences of European imperialism. In this class, we will examine the histories and ideologies of human rights and humanitarianism, consider their underlying assumptions and power dynamics, and investigate the ways these histories relate to current legal, political, and humanitarian organizations and movements.

How have medical debates about sexual contagion both influenced and been influenced by cultural conventions of blame, stigma, and moral judgment? Do representations of STDs provide a window into how a society organizes gendered expectations and constructs an image of deviant sexuality? How have responses to the problem of STDs changed over time?

The Haitian Revolution in World History</strong></span></h3><p><span>Between 1789 and 1804, the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the Atlantic in the “age of democratic revolutions.” This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetorical development of human rights as an agenda in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the promises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrimination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human history. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of globalization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their realization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the history of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved populations of the island.

This class explores the exciting events of the revolution through literature, art, and film and the often-heated debates among historians about the real meaning of these dramatic years.

(5 units)</span></p><a id="id.1x0gk37"></a><h3><span><strong>131. Britain and the First World War</strong></span></h3><p><span>World War I gave birth to a range of difficult questions regarding the relationship between democratic ideals and how societies organize for modern conflicts, setting a strong pattern for the 20th century and continuing to possess strong resonances for today. What strains and opportunities does war place upon democratic societies? Does modern patriotism enable or distort the aspirations of free societies? What forces propel individuals to assist or resist modern war making? This course encourages students to think of war as not an activity solely directed by generals and politicians, but rather a social and cultural event that is formed and negotiated by citizens, workers, and parents. This course places the World War I battlefront in the context of British imperial history, and especially examines how four years of fighting shaped Britain’s modern national and civic identity. Readings and materials cover the significance of the home front in many forms including the propaganda machine, the Irish problem, public school tradition, industrial organization and trade union activity, and the women’s vote campaign. Civic groups organized by peace protesters, conscientious objectors, suffragists, and striking workers will be explored alongside groups such as national service advocates, Empire leagues, Boys Scouts, and civil preparedness organizations.
