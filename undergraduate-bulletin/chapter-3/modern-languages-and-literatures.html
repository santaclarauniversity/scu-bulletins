Our faculty of professional language educators and scholars integrates the teaching of language and culture throughout our curricula in order to enable students to: communicate effectively across cultures; to appreciate cultural diversity; to interpret and discuss words, images, texts, and discourses in their sociocultural context; and to identify and analyze problems across cultural and national boundaries. With rigorous, high-quality programs deeply rooted in our Jesuit values and in the principles of the liberal arts experience, we offer students unique learning experiences, both in and out of the classroom, which enrich their personal lives, help them discern a future career path, and prepare them to compete locally and globally for a wide variety of careers. </span></p><p><span>The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as degree programs leading to the </span><span>Bachelor</span><span> of </span><span>Arts</span><span> in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, </span><span>and</span><span> Spanish studies. Honors programs are available for French majors. The department offers minors in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, Japanese studies, and Spanish studies. Students can also combine language studies, especially Arabic, Chinese, or German with interdisciplinary minors (e.g., Arabic, Islamic, </span><span>and</span><span> Middle Eastern studies</span><span>;</span><span> Asian studies</span><span>; Latin American Studies,</span><span> </span><span>international studies; </span><span>international business), or an individual studies major, which is offered by the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. </span></p><p><span>Many modern languages and literatures’ courses fulfill Core requirements, including the Core Second Language requirement, Cultures &amp; Ideas (1, 2, 3), Diversity, Civic Engagement, ELSJ, and several Pathways. </span><span>All courses are open to any student with the requisite preparation.</span><span> A few</span><span> of these courses are offered in English, as noted in the course descriptions. Courses offered in English do not fulfill the Core Second Language requirement.</span></p><p><span>A</span><span> placement recommendation is a prerequisite for all SCU language courses. All students must complete the language placement process prior to registering for their first language course at SCU. </span><span>See the</span><span> </span><span><a href="https://www.scu.edu/modernlanguages/">Department of Modern Languages and Literatures’ </a></span><span><a href="https://www.scu.edu/modernlanguages/">website</a></span><span> </span><span>for more information on the placement process. </span><span>Study abroad is a valuable enhancement of the undergraduate experience and is particularly recommended for students pursuing a major or minor in a foreign language. Both the </span><span>Global Engagement Office</span><span> and the student’s</span><span> Modern Languages’</span><span> advisor should be consulted to ensure appropriate integration of the work done abroad into the student’s program of study.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2><span><strong>Requirements for the Majors</strong></span></h2><p><span>In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in modern languages and literatures must complete the following departmental requirements for their specific major:</span></p><p><span><strong>Major in French and Francophone Studies</strong></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li><span>FREN 100</span><span>, </span><span>101</span><span> (in any order),</span><span>or department-approved </span><span>substitutions </span></li><li><span>At least one course in French </span><span>and</span><span> Francophone literatures</span></li><li><span>Remaining electives in F</span><span>rench and Francophone</span><span> studies to total 40 quarter upper-division units chosen with the approval of the student’s major advisor.

We will analyze how politics and ideology inform the construction and reproduction of knowledge about the “Other” as well as the complex interactions between race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, exoticism, and the various subject-object positions occupied by the observer, traveler, writer/voyeur.

The French Revolution in a Global Context </strong></span></h3><p><span>This course focuses on the 18th century, called the century of light (meaning the “light” of “reason”), when French writers, philosophers, pamphleteers, artists, who considered themselves European and citizens of the world, shook off traditional authorities of kings, priests, fathers, and refused the legitimacy of ready-made ideas. We shall examine their ideals of liberty, equality, and justice and their attacks on war, colonialism, slavery, the death penalty, intolerance, and religious fanaticism. We will seek to discover the relationship between our societies and their legacy as that legacy had a global impact—inspiring the American and French revolutions. Readings of representative novels, short stories, “discours,” letters and plays, and study of artworks in their cultural (political, social, historical) contexts.

French Perspectives on Social Justice</strong></span></h3><p><span>The term social justice is an old one, dating back at least to Enlightenment France, but it is now more present than ever in 21st century politics and culture, especially in the debates over feminism, sexuality, race, immigration, inequality and environmentalism. This course examines the idea of social justice through the lens of French culture and history, and it raises the following questions: What is social justice? How has it been articulated or invoked?  How can we gain insight into contemporary calls for social justice, both in France and around the world? Class discussions will be structured around short  readings of French history and literature, as well as viewings of world cinema. Prerequisite: FREN 101 or equivalent. (5 units)</span></p><a id="id.3m33h138w75d"></a><h3><span><strong>177. Technology, Science and Society: From Romanticism to the Digital Age</strong></span></h3><p><span>When we think of technology today, we tend to think of smartphones, social media and the Internet. Technology has come to be identified with what is only a particular kind (i.e., information technology), but the concept itself is far broader. Accordingly, this class seeks to study the formative influences and social impacts of technology and techno-culture. Its starting point will be the utopian science of nineteenth-century Paris, which saw the rise of photography, daguerreotypes, automata, panoramas and electrodynamics, amongst other interesting experiments. Such “romantic” technologies were described in terms of spiritual quest and self-expression, often in ways which anticipate contemporary obsessions with social media and technological progress. In order to explore both romantic and present-day understandings of technology and its social implications, we will establish a dialogue between nineteenth-century techno-culture and our current digital age. Prerequisite: FREN 101 or equivalent. (5 units)</span></p><a id="id.3q5sasy"></a><h3><span><strong>182.

Provides information on French women writers’ contributions with, as background, information on French women’s roles and experiences throughout the ages. Special attention will be given to the continuity among women writers and to the impact of their minority status upon their writing. Readings set against the backdrop of the Monarchy, the French Revolution of 1789, the Napoleonic regime, the Franco-Prussian war, and the two World Wars will point out to an emerging feminist awareness that found expression in both literature and political activism.

Politics of Love</strong></span></h3><p><span>Students will focus on the theme of love (from </span><span>the </span><span>passionate love of </span><span>Tristan and Iseult</span><span> to the modern concept of love and marriage) and study how different literary movements have adapted love stories to reflect their values and their visions of the world. Why do these cultural representations and social constructions of the gendered human body and sexuality often show off the social insertion of the hero and the exclusion of feminine characters? In other words, what are the social, sexual, political consequences of the power games present in the love stories read this quarter?
