The major prepares students for a wide variety of careers in the communication, entertainment, tech,</span><span> journalism, and non-profit </span><span> industr</span><span>ies</span><span>. A minor in </span><span>d</span><span>igital </span><span>f</span><span>ilmmaking or </span><span>j</span><span>ournalism is also available. Students explore the theories, research methods, responsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass communication, interpersonal communication, strategic communication, global communication,</span><span> </span><span>and computer-mediated communication. The integrat</span><span>ion of </span><span> theory</span><span> and </span><span>practice is essential to the major. We help students to apply their knowledge of the communication process to create their own speeches, films, television programs, journalism, Web content, and communication and marketing campaigns. Many of our students go directly to work in these fields after graduation. The major also prepares st</span><span>udents for graduate studies in a number of fields, including communication, film, journalism, and law.</span></p><p><span>Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students integrate courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often, students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related disciplines. To encourage students to explore global studies, the department accepts up to two approved study abroad courses toward completion of the communication course requirements, usually as upper-division electives. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus media organization or other communication-related institution. Internships may be counted for course credit as a department elective</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Students can graduate with a general Communication degree where they take a variety of courses from across the communication field, or for those interested in a more focused specialization, they can choose from one of six official emphases: Global Media, Culture &amp; Technology; Leadership Communication; Communication, Diversity &amp; Culture; Film &amp; Culture; Journalism; or Strategic Communication.</span></p><p><span>Students interested in communication, including nonmajors, enjoy a wealth of co-curricular opportunities. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media, including the student newspaper, radio station, and yearbook. Practicum courses allow students to gain academic credit for working in student media.</span></p><p><span>All courses taken to fulfill requirements for the major or minor must be four or five units and must be taken for a letter grade, not on a pass/no pass basis. Practicum courses, numbered 190 through 195, do not count toward fulfillment of the communication major or minor.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2><span><strong>Requirements for the Major</strong></span></h2><p><span>In addition to fulfilling </span><span>u</span><span>ndergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in communication must complete the following departmental requirements</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-0 start"><li><span>Four Foundation Courses (all must be completed before taking other courses):</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-1 start"><li><span>COMM 1</span></li><li><span>COMM 2</span></li><li><span>COMM </span><span>3</span></li><li><span>COMM </span><span>4 (taken after completing 30 units at SCU)</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-0"><li><span>Three Intermediate Courses chosen from the following five courses:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-1 start"><li><span>COMM 10</span></li><li><span>COMM 30</span></li><li><span>COMM 50</span></li><li><span>COMM 60</span></li><li><span>COMM 80</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-0"><li><span>Upper Division Requirements</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-1 start"><li><span>Six elective upper-division communication courses (signified by course numbers 102-189)</span></li><li><span>COMM 100</span></li><li><span>COMM 1</span><span>01</span></li><li><span>COMM 197</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-0"><li><span>For students who declared the major prior to June 2022, the department requirements are:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-1 start"><li><span>COMM 1 (or COMM 10 beginning in Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>COMM 2 ( or COMM 50 or COMM 80 beginning in Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>COMM 12</span></li><li><span>COMM 20 (or COMM 2 beginning in Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>Two Courses from this list</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-2 start"><li><span>COMM 3</span></li><li><span>COMM 30</span></li><li><span>COMM 40 (or COMM 60 beginning in Fall 2022) </span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-1"><li><span>COMM 110 (or COMM 100 beginning in Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>COMM 111 or 111G (or COMM 101 beginning in Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>Six Upper Division Communication elective courses</span></li><li><span>COMM 197 - Senior Portfolio</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><a id="id.tier12e700op"></a><h2 id="h.f39d3k2copeu"><span><strong>Optional Emphases</strong></span></h2><p><span>Communication majors have the option of completing a concentration within the major by selecting one of the emphases listed below. Like the general communication major, each emphasis requires the four foundation courses, three intermediate courses, COMM 100 &amp; 101, COMM 197 and six upper division electives; however, specific courses are identified to meet these requirements. Completion of an emphasis will be noted on student transcripts. Students may only complete one emphasis.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span><strong>Global Media, Culture, and Technologies</strong></span></p><p><span>The Global Media, Culture, and Technology emphasis focuses on the complex intersections of media, culture, and technology in our globalized world. The relationship between media, culture, and technology takes diverse forms in different global contexts: from the powerful ways in which Silicon Valley social media behemoths like Facebook shape politics and culture in the Bay Area or Brazil to the role of hip-hop to register political protest among French immigrant communities, from the mobilization of newspapers by social movements centered on gender equity in India to the representation of disability in Iranian cinema. Cumulatively, the emphasis will cover important theoretical perspectives on global media, culture, and technology, provide students with a grounding in the history and political economy of global media technologies and industries, examine representation in different media forms and genres, and engage with questions of audience, reception, and affect. The question of what it means to be a critically engaged consumer, producer, and reader/viewer of global media is a key imperative that animates the emphasis. This emphasis communicates to students that we live in a global world, not as glib consumers of products but as global citizens who need competencies to engage with a constantly shifting, complex, and interconnected world. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span><strong>Specific requirements to fulfill the Global Media, Culture and Technologies emphasis:</strong></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_63x9vkhzwca8-0 start"><li><span>COMM 80: Global Media, Culture &amp; Technology (or COMM 2 prior to Fall 2022)</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_63x9vkhzwca8-0"><li><span>At least two upper division electives from this list:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_63x9vkhzwca8-1 start"><li><span>COMM 108: Special Topics in Global Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 141: AI and the Human in Cinema</span></li><li><span>COMM 142: Visual Cultural Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 144: Diversity in Media</span></li><li><span>COMM 171: Technology and Inequality in the Silicon Valley</span></li><li><span>COMM 180: Global Popular Culture</span></li><li><span>COMM 181A: Asian Pop Culture: Global Influence and Political Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 181D: Disability in Global Popular Culture</span></li><li><span>COMM 183: Communication, Development, and Social Change</span></li><li><span>COMM 184: Global Media and Postcolonial Identity</span></li><li><span>COMM 185: Identity, Privacy, and Politics in the Digital Age</span></li><li><span>COMM 187: Media and Social Movements</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_63x9vkhzwca8-0"><li><span>At least one upper division elective course from this list:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_63x9vkhzwca8-1 start"><li><span>COMM 114: Body Politics</span></li><li><span>COMM 115: Communication and Gender</span></li><li><span>COMM 115G: Gender, Health and Sexuality</span></li><li><span>COMM 116: Intercultural Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 116G: Global Interpersonal Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 133: Hybrid Forms of Film</span></li><li><span>COMM 137: American Film History</span></li><li><span>COMM 143: Cinema in a Global World</span></li><li><span>COMM 145: The Business of Media</span></li><li><span>COMM 154: Media Audience Studies</span></li><li><span>COMM 189: Communication, Identity and Citizenship in Asia</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><p><span><br></span><span><strong>Leadership Communication</strong></span></p><p><span>Leadership is a process of social influence through which individuals move people toward a particular goal. Communication serves a core function in this process, as good leaders are often defined by their ability to communicate effectively. Much like other forms of communication, leadership involves a dynamic and symbolic exchange of ideas between groups of people, members of teams, and within organizations. Furthermore, leadership and what constitutes a “good leader” is a highly socialized construction. Leadership is also bounded by important social concepts including issues of (dis)abilities, ethnicity, gender and gender identities, race, sexuality, and socio-economic status. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Students who advance through the Leadership Communication Emphasis will not only learn about effective messaging, but will also develop competencies in areas that are critical to holistic leadership, such as conflict management, listening, intercultural communication, and ethics.

Moreover, cultural communication competency is now an essential job skill in our global world. Friends, families, co-workers, and communities—local, regional, national, transnational—thrive when individuals and groups critically examine systemic hierarchies based on gender, race, ethnicity, cisheteronormativity, and socioeconomic class and actively use communication to challenge and dismantle those hierarchies through everyday communication and through all forms of media artwork, advocacy, and organizing. This emphasis engages the role of all forms and channels of communication and media in constructing, reflecting, representing, and managing diverse identities and interactions through interpersonal, organizational, institutional, and mediated channels. Courses in this emphasis engage with the full spectrums of sexes and genders, racial and multiracial classifications, socioeconomic classes, sexualities, (dis)abilities, citizenship and migrant statuses, and other key identities as they manifest in a dynamic world. Students will develop their own critical standpoints while learning to understand and respect those of others.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span><strong>Specific requirements to fulfill the Communication, Diversity, and Culture emphasis:</strong></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_sksxxtqegbwr-0 start"><li><span>COMM 10: Social Interaction (or COMM 1 prior to Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>COMM 80: Global Media, Culture &amp; Technology (or COMM 2 prior to Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>Four upper division electives from this list:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_yjcuaxfn018t-0 start"><li><span>COMM 114: Body Politics</span></li><li><span>COMM 115: Communication and Gender</span></li><li><span>COMM 115G: Gender, Health and Sexuality</span></li><li><span>COMM 115J: Gender &amp; Leadership</span></li><li><span>COMM 115V: Vocation and Gender</span></li><li><span>COMM 116: Intercultural Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 116G: Global Interpersonal Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 116M: Multicultural</span><span><strong> </strong></span><span>Family and Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 117: Multicultural Folktales and Storytelling</span></li><li><span>COMM 140: Race, Gender &amp; Film</span></li><li><span>COMM 140B: Black Cinema</span></li><li><span>COMM 140C: Latinx Cinema</span></li><li><span>COMM 140W: Women in Cinema</span></li><li><span>COMM 140Q: Queer Cinema</span></li><li><span>COMM 142: Visual Cultural Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 144: Diversity in Media</span></li><li><span>COMM 171: Technology and Inequality in the Silicon Valley</span></li><li><span>COMM 181D: Disability in Global Popular Culture</span></li><li><span>COMM 183: Communication, Development and Social Change</span></li><li><span>COMM 187: Media and Social Movements</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Digital Filmmaking encourages students to discover their voice using film to inspire social change.

Health Communication</strong></span></h3><p><span>Communication concerning health, fitness, illness, disease, and medicine surrounds us.   The communication you have with friends and family and the information you receive from the  media affects the interaction you have with health care providers and the decisions you make about caring for your physical, mental, and emotional health.  In addition, as health care is organized in increasingly complex ways, communicating between health care professionals and with patients can be ineffective. </span><span>This course provides an opportunity to explore the multiple communication issues relevant to health including language, information processing, and cultural construction of health and illness.

Dark Side of Communication</strong></span></h3><p><span>Not all communication is healthy and productive and scholars have long been fascinated with what happens when communication “goes wrong.” This class will explore how communication can lead to problems in relationships, families, and organizations. The course will explore ways that dark and destructive communication can have detrimental effects on relationships. Exploration into the dark side will include topics such as jealousy, obsessive relational intrusion (stalking), infidelity, stress, burnout, unrequited love, social pain, exclusion, harassment, incivility, bullying, deception, and deceptive affection. The main goal of the course will be to find ways to move from the dark to the light, as some of these dark side concepts have a bright side -- they help people understand themselves, their relationships, their workplaces, and their families even better. For dark side topics that do not have a bright side (e.g., stalking) the course will focus on how individuals might support others who have experienced these things. The course will also evaluate how these dark side topics have disproportionate effects on members of BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and other marginalized communities.
