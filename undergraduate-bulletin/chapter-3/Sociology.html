Students practice being &quot;public sociologists&quot; by enlisting knowledge and research to encourage individual, societal, and political decisions that are ethical and justice-oriented. A background in philosophical ethics helps public sociologists consider their own moral development as well as the salient issues at stake when considering potential solutions to controversial social problems. Thus, being a public sociologist means taking a stand on complex ethical issues by having a foundation in both philosophical and sociological moral methodology. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="128-religion-science-and-technology">128. Religion, Science, and Technology</h3>

Essential skills, such as creativity, critical and ethical thinking, reflection, transformative communication, leadership, empathy, and teamwork, are enhanced. Students participate in a human-centered design thinking skills training, innovate a solution to a social or environmental problem, and create a business model canvas and case study of the innovation for the final project. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="soci-131---sociology-of-gender">SOCI 131 - Sociology of Gender</h3>
<p>Gender is a central organizing principle in social relations, giving rise to institutional and social practices that distinguish between men and women on the basis of apparent difference and inequality. This course develops the sociological analysis of gender systems in contemporary American society. In this course, we will critically examine the multiple ways that gender (and connections between gender, race, and sexuality) structures the social world in which we live, and the way that race and sexuality interact with gender.</p>
<h3 id="132-inequality-and-the-american-dream">132. Inequality and the American Dream</h3>
<p>This course examines how inequality has emerged and is sustained in American society, and how it has contributed to the creation of a social hierarchy---that is, the process of social stratification. We will specifically examine this phenomena through the lenses of economic class, which is the root of social stratification theory, as well as gender and race.
