<p>The Department of Communication offers a program of studies leading to a bachelor of arts in communication. The major prepares students for a wide variety of careers in the communication, entertainment, tech, journalism, and non-profit industries. A minor in digital filmmaking or journalism is also available. Students explore the theories, research methods, responsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass communication, interpersonal communication, strategic communication, global communication, and computer-mediated communication. The integration of theory and practice is essential to the major. We help students to apply their knowledge of the communication process to create their own speeches, films, television programs, journalism, Web content, and communication and marketing campaigns. Many of our students go directly to work in these fields after graduation. The major also prepares students for graduate studies in a number of fields, including communication, film, journalism, and law.</p>
<p>Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students integrate courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often, students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related disciplines. To encourage students to explore global studies, the department accepts up to two approved study abroad courses toward completion of the communication course requirements, usually as upper-division electives. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus media organization or other communication-related institution. Internships may be counted for course credit as a department elective. Students can graduate with a general Communication degree where they take a variety of courses from across the communication field, or for those interested in a more focused specialization, they can choose from one of six official emphases: Global Media, Culture &amp; Technology; Leadership Communication; Communication, Diversity &amp; Culture; Film &amp; Culture; Journalism; or Strategic Communication.</p>
<p>Students interested in communication, including nonmajors, enjoy a wealth of co-curricular opportunities. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media, including the student newspaper, radio station, and yearbook. Practicum courses allow students to gain academic credit for working in student media.</p>
<p>All courses taken to fulfill requirements for the major or minor must be four or five units and must be taken for a letter grade, not on a pass/no pass basis. Practicum courses, numbered 190 through 195, do not count toward fulfillment of the communication major or minor.</p>

<h2 id="optional-emphases">Optional Emphases</h2>
<p>Communication majors have the option of completing a concentration within the major by selecting one of the emphases listed below. Like the general communication major, each emphasis requires the four foundation courses, three intermediate courses, COMM 100 &amp; 101, COMM 197 and six upper division electives; however, specific courses are identified to meet these requirements. Completion of an emphasis will be noted on student transcripts. Students may only complete one emphasis.</p>
<p><strong>Global Media, Culture, and Technologies</strong></p>
<p>The Global Media, Culture, and Technology emphasis focuses on the complex intersections of media, culture, and technology in our globalized world. The relationship between media, culture, and technology takes diverse forms in different global contexts: from the powerful ways in which Silicon Valley social media behemoths like Facebook shape politics and culture in the Bay Area or Brazil to the role of hip-hop to register political protest among French immigrant communities, from the mobilization of newspapers by social movements centered on gender equity in India to the representation of disability in Iranian cinema. Cumulatively, the emphasis will cover important theoretical perspectives on global media, culture, and technology, provide students with a grounding in the history and political economy of global media technologies and industries, examine representation in different media forms and genres, and engage with questions of audience, reception, and affect. The question of what it means to be a critically engaged consumer, producer, and reader/viewer of global media is a key imperative that animates the emphasis. This emphasis communicates to students that we live in a global world, not as glib consumers of products but as global citizens who need competencies to engage with a constantly shifting, complex, and interconnected world.</p>

<p><strong>Leadership Communication</strong></p>
<p>Leadership is a process of social influence through which individuals move people toward a particular goal. Communication serves a core function in this process, as good leaders are often defined by their ability to communicate effectively. Much like other forms of communication, leadership involves a dynamic and symbolic exchange of ideas between groups of people, members of teams, and within organizations. Furthermore, leadership and what constitutes a &quot;good leader&quot; is a highly socialized construction. Leadership is also bounded by important social concepts including issues of (dis)abilities, ethnicity, gender and gender identities, race, sexuality, and socio-economic status.</p>
<p>Students who advance through the Leadership Communication Emphasis will not only learn about effective messaging, but will also develop competencies in areas that are critical to holistic leadership, such as conflict management, listening, intercultural communication, and ethics. Students engaged in this emphasis will critique contemporary leadership and focus their attention on how leadership can be a force for social change and justice.</p>

<p><strong>Communication, Diversity, and Culture</strong></p>
<p>Appreciation for cultural diversity is at the heart of SCU&apos;s mission to educate whole persons to make a more just, humane, and sustainable world. Moreover, cultural communication competency is now an essential job skill in our global world. Friends, families, co-workers, and communities---local, regional, national, transnational---thrive when individuals and groups critically examine systemic hierarchies based on gender, race, ethnicity, cisheteronormativity, and socioeconomic class and actively use communication to challenge and dismantle those hierarchies through everyday communication and through all forms of media artwork, advocacy, and organizing. This emphasis engages the role of all forms and channels of communication and media in constructing, reflecting, representing, and managing diverse identities and interactions through interpersonal, organizational, institutional, and mediated channels. Courses in this emphasis engage with the full spectrums of sexes and genders, racial and multiracial classifications, socioeconomic classes, sexualities, (dis)abilities, citizenship and migrant statuses, and other key identities as they manifest in a dynamic world. Students will develop their own critical standpoints while learning to understand and respect those of others.</p>

<h3 id="146-hybrid-films">146. Hybrid Films</h3>
<p>This course will immerse students in the history and aesthetics of film work that lies on the border between fiction and nonfiction. We live in a film culture that encourages us to think of fiction and documentary as distinct forms. Recent world cinema has given birth to a wave of films that resist those categories, that blur those distinctions, and instead explore the productive liminal zone in between. All fiction films, no matter how staged, contain a trace of reality, an element of chance. The inverse is also true: no nonfiction film is ever completely devoid of manipulation. Students will view and analyze works by contemporary filmmakers working in the hybrid space.

Several questions will guide the course: What is media literacy? How do historical and economic context affect the way we process information we are exposed to? How can individuals become more media literate to cope and manage information overload? These questions are particularly urgent for us to think about in relation to contemporary digital communication, as they are increasing the amount of information we are exposed to. We explore these questions through various activities in the course, reviewing what media literacy is, what components are needed to become media literate, and how to use a media literacy approach to dissect different types of industry through practical application.

We will critically examine how characters in global media culture both reflect and challenge the perspectives on disability identified above. We will unpack how ideas of disability as a type of difference intersect with perceptions of racial, ethnic, gender, national, and sexual difference, whether the intellectual inferiority of colonized peoples, and the newly resurgent scientific emphasis on innate biological differences between men and women. Course materials include readings from social theory, media and cultural studies, and historical studies of disability. Additionally, we will read, listen to, view, and analyze a number of media and cultural texts, including film,episodes of animated television series, iconic works of art, musical compositions, and public online forums of communities of self-identified disabled groups.

<h3 id="188-food-and-communication">188. Food and Communication</h3>
<p>This upper-division seminar explores the rich, multifaceted, and fascinating relationship between food and communication from the following complementary perspectives. One, we will analyze food as a form of communication, reflecting on what food tells us about society, culture, and identity. What kinds of tensions---for example, between individual choice and collective obligations, national identity and cosmopolitan aspirations, tradition and modernity---are associated with food-related practices? How do we respond to the competing ethical claims of vegetarianism and meat-eating? Two, we will examine communication about food, closely reading representations of food in different forms of media, including art, cinema, television shows, and graphic novels. And, finally, we will look at food as the site and space of cultural encounters, as a marker of both similarity in difference. Course readings and materials are drawn from a number of disciplinary backgrounds, including cultural studies, sociology, media studies, and food studies, and from a range of media genres. Within this broad framework, students will develop an original thesis related to food and communication and produce a high-quality research paper by the end of the seminar. (5 units)</p>
<h3 id="189-communication-identity-and-citizenship-in-asia">189. Communication, Identity, and Citizenship in Asia</h3>
<p>Citizenship is about belonging. With abundant transnational cultural influences, multinational treaties, and cross-border marriages, the belonging process is complicated.

Students will learn how the thinking and making of citizens has changed, and are encouraged to imagine how it can continue to change in the future. This course fulfills the Core requirement for C&amp;I 3 and the Asian Studies minor. Prerequisite: COMM 2 (prior to Fall 2022) or COMM 80 or ETHN 5 or permission of instructor. (5 units)</p>
