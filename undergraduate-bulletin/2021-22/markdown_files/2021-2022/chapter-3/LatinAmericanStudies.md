Latin American Studies
======================

*Director:* Alberto Ribas-Casasayas, Department of Modern Languages and Literatures

Through the study of cultures, societies, and history of the Latin American region and Latin diaspora, the interdisciplinary minor in Latin American Studies (LAS) helps students develop:

-   global competence

-   cross-cultural awareness and communication

-   appreciation of social diversity and inclusion

-   understanding of the connections between Latin America and Latin American immigrant communities in the United States and other parts of the world.

These skills will be of service in careers in business, government and public service, international marketing, law, and nonprofit organizations. It also serves as a substantial foundation for graduate studies in disciplines such as Anthropology, History, Political Science, and Sociology, as well as any cultural or interdisciplinary studies with a focus on Latin America and other regional studies.

The minor requires demonstrated competence in one language spoken in Latin America, two foundational courses that offer an overall view of the region, and completion of more focused optional courses dealing with specific countries or themes.

Requirements for the Minor
--------------------------

To qualify for the minor, students must meet a language requirement and complete seven courses in the field of Latin American Studies. At least four of those must be upper-division courses. Courses must be chosen from at least three different departments.

Substantial credit from study abroad will be considered for course credit by the LAS director. An immersion experience relevant to Latin America, when complemented with significant written work upon the student's return, may also be considered for credit.

**Language Requirement**

Successful completion of an upper-division SPAN course, level 100 or above; or equivalent Spanish or Portuguese language proficiency demonstrated by passing an examination given by the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures; or successful completion of one upper-division course in Latin American literature and culture taught in Spanish.

Note: Any upper-division SPAN course taught in Spanish may be used to meet the language requirement, but only courses dealing with Latin America count towards the 7-course requirement.

**Foundational Course I**

The first group of foundational courses serves as an introduction to the Latin American region before the contemporary period. To meet this requirement, students must take one course dealing with Latin America as a region, focusing on any defined period or topic between the Precolumbian Era and late 19th century.

Some recent offerings include:

-   ANTH 185. Peoples of Latin America

-   ANTH 186. Mesoamerican Prehistory

-   HIST 166. Latin America: Empires

-   ARTH 11. Art of Contact: New Worlds.

-   ARTH 25. Indigenous Visions.

**Foundational Course II**

The second foundational requirement serves as an introduction to Latin American culture and civilization focusing on the formation of Latin American nation-states in the 19th century and the forces shaping Latin American nations in the 20th and 21st centuries. A course dealing with Latin America as a region, in a period from the wars of independence to present, will meet this requirement.

Some recent offerings include: :

-   HIST 95. Modern Latin America

-   SPAN 137. Latin American Cultures and Civilizations

-   SPAN 146. Latin America through the Documentary Lens

-   SPAN 147. Cinema, Politics, and Society in Latin America

Students may take more than one Foundational I or II course. These shall go towards fulfilling the elective requirement.

In very specific circumstances, a course may be approved for either F-I or F-II, but under no circumstance may it be used to fulfill both requirements.

**Latin American Electives.** Four elective courses. Below is a partial list of courses recently taught at SCU that may be used to fulfill this requirement. Note the list may not be complete. Any course of instruction dealing in its entirety or substantially with a Latin American country or the region as a whole may count towards fulfilling a Latin American elective requirement. A course that has been used to fulfill a foundational requirement cannot be used to meet an elective requirement.
