The Global Fellows Program is a nine-month, mixed disciplinary program dedicated to fostering global citizens of competence, conscience, and compassion.

The Global Fellows Program sends up to 30 students to work for a nongovernmental organization (NGO) or business that embodies the ideal of global leadership and reflects the increasing level of globalization in our world. Each organization varies in its methods and values. All provide an exposure to global citizenship through an enhanced understanding of cultural, economic, social, political, and technological factors that underlie social injustice, marginalization, and privilege. Selected fellows participate in a spring quarter leadership practicum that engages their knowledge of global citizenship and what it means to be a leader in the 21st century. Following spring quarter, fellows head to a developing country for a 6- to 8-week internship with the organization for whom they have been selected. The Global Fellows Program is a unique program, offering a global professional and civic engagement opportunity, comprised of internship, travel, and cultural immersion.
