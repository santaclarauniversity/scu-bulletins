### 181. Conscientious Capitalism

The foundation of Conscientious Capitalism is: "To lead others, I will first learn to lead myself." The course is designed to inspire and teach students the role of purpose, virtue, intentionality, tenacity, and accountability in their leadership journey. The course uses three distinct but related activities to achieve this goal. Nationally renowned business, military, and civic leaders share the experiences and challenges that shaped them, their careers, and major decisions. The goal of having iconic leaders share with honesty and vulnerability is to inspire students to do the same in the course and their lives. Harvard Business School cases give students the opportunity to learn from the most critical business and policy decisions of our times. Putting students in the role of decision-maker challenges them to understand the complexity of decision making and leadership, and begins to train them for their careers post SCU. Leadership Development Teams (LDTs) are small, mentored groups. The goal is for students to explore and share their authentic selves and develop the courage to live as their authentic selves in their careers and lives. Note: We seek evidence of a student's ambition to make an impact and the hunger and maturity to pursue the journey of self-awareness, authenticity, and courageous action. (5 units)
